"1",2041390765,"Sometimes members of congress don’t do what they know they need to do, just because they don’t want a president from the other party to be successful. This is a problem with congress members who’ve been in congress for too long. Unfortunately, the people in this country are uneducated about how businesses operate or how economies work. Sometimes, action simply needs to be taken."
"2",2040611197,"Why do I think Democrats can't get cooperation from the GOP? Because I read the news and KNOW McConnell said when Obama was elected his MAIN prioroty was to oppose anything and everything the Democrats proposed. Now it's worse and the GOP is justifying attacks on the Govt, Paul Pelosi, 1/6 and callking neo-Nazo's vey fine people. They've lots the POPULAR vote repoeatedly. Fox News should be banned."
"3",2041855485,"Because our representatives currently don't represent the populace. The GOP has rigged elections in their favor with extreme gerimandering and voter suppression laws so that they can ""win"" with fewer votes. Then they represent their big campaign donors who are at odds with the majority of Americans! The Cons in Congress vote against legislation that the majority of Americans want and constantly obstruct the will of the people!"
"4",2051427589,"Look how many inept judges that Mitch McConnel has appointed the last few years is why I said this"
"5",2041854291,"The GOP is currently dragging America down the road of fascism. Voting and standing by will no longer stop the treachery and violence of the GOP. We must meet their tactics head-on. If this is the only way to restore democracy - which it is - so be it."
"6",2040484635,"Because I believe (pretty strongly) that the media is very biased against Republicans than they are against the Democrats who control them. And, this is because the media does not like Conservative thinking."
"7",2040652881,"Because it is legal and constitutional for the president to issue executive orders, and thus it does not go against the rules that make the representative democracy work to try to use them. It would then be up to the courts to determine if the executive orders were within what the president is legally allowed to do, and the courts' decision should then be followed."
"8",2040699157,"because the ""new laws"" may be so important (i.e. measures to counteract a medical pandemic); or because the new laws may be grossly unpopular with voters who put in just barely enough congressmen to keep congress from acting (i.e. number of votes in Senate would be less than would be required to overcome a fillibuster); or the new laws would help an unpopular minority overcome terrible pain or hardship."
"9",2043491975,"If it’s the people’s will….yes"
"10",2043316149,"democrats have turned to pushing communism and should be resisted in every possible"
"11",2041991035,"it's not fair to the Republican party"
"12",2050050103,"Because Democrats lie and cheat. They think its their divine right to get whst they want. I woukd never vote fo3 a Democrat"
"13",2048280239,"Sometimes you have to do things to move important legislation forward"
"14",2049291673,"It seems that democrats get what they want easier than republicans and I think alot of it is dishonest"
"15",2042181321,"Our system of checks and balances has been deeply eroded by the Republican party doing things like denying a Democratic president (Obama) to appoint a supreme court justice. The result has been a number of supreme court decisions that are partisan and do not reflect the will of the people."
"16",2043569365,"Every Party should have the same rules and follow them"
"17",2043591805,"Democrats and Republican are always fighting with each other and do not work together for the good of the country so if the Republican president has a good need for the country he should be able to do what ever he can to get the need passed. The Democrats will do the same. Democrats and Republicans will never agree with each other no matter how good the need might help the country."
"18",2043489109,"I can't"
"19",2047730955,"demarcates cheat and fix election."
"20",2048945003,"I only agree because the president only holds so much power and in all honestly can only accomplish a certain degree of success that can be reversed later where as when congress passes Bills into laws they are laws and much harder to reverse so if the GOP refuses to pass bills benefiting the American people and the president can make some difference since he was elected to the office them he should exercise that power to benefit Americans"
"21",2049448969,"Because some of these things are needed in a hurry."
"22",2041640325,"I answered that question too quickly. I do not believe the Democratic president should circumvent Congress and issue executive orders on their own."
"23",2040523935,"Because the Republican members of congress care more about obstruction than compromise and are unwilling to work with the Democrats"
"24",2042399529,"The Republican party as it is now is less concerned with fairness and democratic values than with power at any cost."
"25",2043431091,"I believe the democratic president should issue executive orders that fall within their authority without overstepping the authority of congress."
"26",2037589131,"Republicans are turning into fascist"
"27",2041372277,"The democrats have bypassed congress over and over again with executive orders for instance student loan forgiveness, closing the pipelines and so on. If they don’t want a republican president to do it then they shouldn’t do it either! So tired of the democrats bullying Christian’s and conservatives and calling us racist!"
"28",2041294711,"Executive orders can be overturned by Congress as well as by the Supreme Court. I do not consider them to be in violation of the ideals of representative democracy."
"29",2051425009,"That's what the Republicans do. The dems need to get up to speed on this one. Rs have rewritten the constitution to make this sop."
"30",2042502871,"because usually the dem members of congress are passing laws that aren't good for all the people"
"31",2043519813,"Any POTUS that is facing a party that is one hundred percent against said POSTUS should use executive orders because those orders are easy to challenge in courts and someone must take action against cultish behavior within our government. No single branch of our government should be in lockstep with a single ideology."
"32",2040661799,"Because Republicans don’t always represent the people. They oftentimes favor the interests of the wealthy. Executive Orders can be and often are reversed by subsequent administrations. Some issues can’t wait for Congress to decide, I.e. DACA."
"33",2042285613,"Republicans lately have refused to work across the aisle leaving executive order the only alternative"
"34",2042391943,"I just fell you should support the party you belive in"
"35",2048730137,"I have no comment"
"36",2042739627,"It depends on what the laws are about and whether the majority of the people support the law that was trying to be passed"
"37",2043546873,"Because an appointee by a Democratic president would not be in favor of a representative democracy."
"38",2041375267,"I said that because that is exactly the way things are right now. Democrats blatantly and openly attack Republicans over everything they say and do. The media is so biased and government just goes along with anything Democrats and the media puts out there. You know that's true."
"39",2050555441,"Sometimes the issue is very important for the people if it's within the law it should happen"
"40",2043504741,"Because the media nowadays seems to hide certain issues for example Hunter Biden that could have influenced the 2020 elections, immediately find and report faults of republican Canidates. Honest and fair reporting does not see to exist anymore."
"41",2041591569,"Given that those judges (thinking of the Supreme Court) were appointed under false pretenses, it's hard to condone supporting any of their rulings."
"42",2043292903,"I realized I should not have said. Free speech is important to our democracy."
"43",2041557119,"If the stated purpose of the Republican Party as articulated by the Republican leaders in the House and Senate is to make a Democratic president a one-term pres. and to not allow, bring to a vote legislation for the benefit well-being of the people, then as his prerogative, he will have to use executive orders as given to him, to do the will of the people."
"44",2041710645,"This practice is common to all administrations, regardless of party. The only solution is to change the guidelines of the Presidents power. My answer was based on laws that are necessary but not passed by congress due to unhealthy partisanship. A President may have no recourse but Executive Power to exercise legislation that is best for the country and not a specific segment of the population or party. Finally, though the questions references a Republican President, I would answer the same if it was a Democratic President. As a side note, I was hoping the new administration would bring the parties closer, unfortunately, it is as divisive as the previous administration."

"47",2041856671,"Executive Orders are only possible in a limited number of situations, so Presidents can't do just as they like. Republicans are currently far more obstructive, so to get anything done, occasionally, an Executive Order is necessary."
"48",2043347097,"I have watched elected Democrat Presidents from Bill Clinton to Joe Biden completely ignore court decisions that went against their policies. I am sick and tired of Republicans playing a fair game while the Democrats run roughshod over the Constitution. It is time for the Republicans to take the gloves off and get as dirty as the Democrats have done for the last 50 years or more."
"49",2043520999,"It is all 1 party"
"50",2040565607,"all elections shoiuld be fair"
"51",2041471119,"First of all it applies to both parties. Our representatives need to compromise to pass needed legislation."

"53",2041985063,"They need work together to help"
"54",2043071409,"democrats are pure evil and all need to be gone. the democrats judges do not follow the laws. that our fore father set for us. they are pure evil commies that want us to have no rights at all."
"55",2043416237,"taxs"
"56",2043870161,"they have proven that they will use them to cheat"
"57",2041793809,"Executive orders are limited in scope, and while they can further one’s agenda, it is less impactful than passing legislation."
"58",2043242501,"they should always be loyal to the prty but never lie"
"59",2043859741,"No response"
"60",2041400431,"Because some of the Republican appointed judges are corrupt!"
"61",2041427257,"The playing field needs to be level for both parties. Censoring is always wrong."
"62",2048213873,"The true i not sure"
"63",2040729191,"I am tired of 24 seven media coverage that misrepresents either party. Who do you think the media misrepresents most...."
"64",2041825505,"Because those media outlets aren't going to be more fair on their own. They will need more help making better decisions not being biased. I don't watch because I get tired of their practices."
"65",2042051007,"I feel that they should circumvent the Congress because the president is an elected official and people voted for the president for a reason so they have the power to use an executive order.This is not circumvent democracy because the buck stops with the president so it should be the final decision if he wants to have an executive order. People can vote him out if they don’t like how he runs the country."
"66",2042769059,"The president is also elected and has the power to do that. They should do that because it is part of their job"
"67",2043636207,"Because it is obvious that derain media stations are bought and paid for by the democraps and the only ones I have found to be truthful are little known media stations or FOX news"
"68",2042391151,"Democratic Presidents are usually fought on most issues they support by Republicans because for my point of view, Democrats are usually on the side of Democracy, whereas Republicans are usually just on the side of the wealthy and rich people. Rich people always do better under Republican Administrations whereas Poor people always do better under Democratic Administrations. The Republican Party has been taken over by Former President Donald Trump."
"69",2048218559,"Na"
"70",2040892919,"It is a tradition and a good remedy for Presidents to issue Executive Orders if they believe that the measure or law under question is important enough for them to circumvent Congress, but especially recently and these days, when Republicans do their utmost not to pass laws sponsored by Democrats or those approved by a Democratic President. As a matter of fact, one might say that under these circumstances, issuing Executive Orders is an extension of democracy, not its negation."
"71",2042500099,"I believe I also said that Republican presidents should do the same thing. Congress currently is stymied by a divided Senate. Almost no legislation is happening, but there are issues that must be addressed. If Congress refuses to act, the President should in such instances."
"72",2049391785,"Because there's an extremely high likelihood that there was something illegal done. Republicans don't question things unless they're true."
"73",2040527103,"As we saw during the Obama Administration, opposition by the Republicans resulted in gridlock and the inability of Pres. Obama to be able to accomplish any part of his agenda. If it is in the best interest of the Country that certain pieces of policy become law, then the President should use whatever means necessary to bring about policy that will benefit the Country."
"74",2040569359,"Go back and review what Mitch said when Obama was elected. They are refusing to debate issues and blocking bill that some republican members would support but are afraid to speak out. A president has the right to represent the interest of those who elected him or her as long as it is within the law"
"75",2041137129,"Beacause I do not trust republicans at all."
"76",2041855461,"Executive orders are necessary if the other party is not negotiating with the Democrats on good faith."
"77",2040892977,"No clue"
"78",2042360655,"opposing viewpoints should be represented equally. when the media decides to outright lie about issues about one side and blatantly tell you that one side is bad and call it news, they should be censored. news is news, not someone's opinion. report the facts and let the viewers decide."
"79",2043657871,"it's because the republican don't want to talk about anything they just wants to block everything"
"80",2040725103,"At this point in our history today, the bulk of republicans are validating violence more than the democrats. Violent rhetoric should be censored on both sides but the Trump republicans are okay with violence with outright lies that can be proven are false"
"81",2043544941,"If we were living in the time of our parents Democrats I would of said no to the question. However todays Democrats think things like gender assignment and going behind parents back is OK. Todays Democrats think that parents should be jailed if they want to know what is going on with THEIR children in schools. Todays Democrats think that yelling"" create a crowd and push back""( Maxine Waters )when you see a Republican at a restaurant or a gas station. Todays Democrats call burning down city's "" peaceful protests"""
"82",2041647961,"Democrats have been attacked alot lately. Nancy Pelosi's husband was attacked."
"83",2039976949,"Because today the opposing parties don't make decisions to do what is best for America, they do what is best for their party. The people elect a president because they want his agenda. Being blocked because you are of a different party is not how the system was meant to work. If his ideas are truly bad he wouldn't have won."
"84",2040766001,"The media is a mouthpiece and since the laws were changed in the late 80s and Rupert Murdoch began using Fox News to spread outright LIES, the country has become more divided. People are being unduly influenced to buy into a far right agenda that is not in our interest as a nation. I'm not interested in censorship of partisan politics; however, when partisan politics turns into propaganda and non-factual, it's just 'free speech' - it's opinion, not reporting. And I personally believe that hate speech should not be necessarily protected as free speech."
"85",2039325977,"not sure"
"86",2047218259,"It should only do it if the people want it done."
"87",2043586507,"Republican leaders are openly talking about doing this and FAR FAR WORSE. You can't win by playing by the rules, when the opposing team flagrantly refuses to play by the rules. I wish our democracy was functional, but that's not the reality. I'd rather live under Democrats who bend the rules than let fascists turn the country into a hellscape."
"88",2041165193,"Because I think the Republicans got cheated when we voted for the president. I think there was fraud involved"
"89",2043283337,"I believe that politics is so divided among party lines that sometimes it takes executive orders from the president to help get laws passed to help the American people."
"90",2044489409,"Because The Repubs That Has A Majority In A State Has Changed Every Voting District In Their State To Their Advantage."
"91",2042502891,"I guess because I feel if you belong to one party or another either or you should be loyal to that party."
"92",2042101577,"Didn't understand the question when I read it. Do not agree."
"93",2041956831,"Executive orders don't create new laws. They only allow the president to influence the implementation of existing laws. The reason executive orders have become more widely used more recently by both Democratic and Republican presidents is because Congress has become more polarized and dysfunctional, so the Executive branch has moved to fill in the gap. If Congress truly represented the will of the people, it would be less polarized and Democrats would have greater representation. Instead, the House is gerrymandered to the point where Democrats have to win overall by at least 7% just to achieve parity, and the 50% of senators who are Republicans only represent 43% of the American people. Until these disparities are addressed, the president has no choice but to issue executive orders."
"94",2042391713,"Because those issue are for the good of the people and should be given the chance to work through the process and pass them."
"95",2042496903,"Because executive orders are NOT illegal or unconstitutional. Also, it is a bit concerning that this question equates laws (passed by Congress; signed, or not, by the President) and executive orders (issued by the President; lasts until the next President). As you know, testing the instrument is an important part of survey research."
"96",2043750911,"The Democrats won’t receive too many votes should there polling stations be in areas that support Republicans. It’s just something I think would be true."
"97",2042242811,"because they are president and majority in congress"
"98",2040485759,"They should all be loyal"
"99",2040524647,"No comment"
"100",2042827039,"if the press is not reporting truth or opinion only they need to be made to tell the truth"
"101",2050845611,"Democracy is what this country is"
"102",2040652687,"Democratic President Biden has been issuing executive orders on his own since he took office. Turn around is fair play."
"103",2036354241,"Only way to accomplish goals"
"104",2040690527,"Obama was forced to issue executive orders to get the peoples work done. Trump did the same thing, but the orders were for the benefit of the Republican Party and not for the good of all the US citizens."
"105",2043797389,"Neither party should be able to attack the other party on media sources. Level the mental playing field. Regardless of my opinion regarding representative democracy."
"106",2044254655,"There are certain things that can help everyone. And sometimes Republicans vote against it just because they don't want a democratic to get credit for it."
"107",2043213285,"There has always been the option of executive orders."
"108",2049958661,"It is quite obvious that the GOP has adopted an obstructionist approach to any policy set forth by the Democrats. This is a formula developed since the Reagan era and has sacrificed the well-being of the US people while focusing on the retention of power. Under these conditions, and the existence of the filibuster, it’s often the case that an executive order is required to reflect the will of the people."
"109",2043495787,"Because Republicons are the crooks"
"110",2040374525,"Actually I think it depends on what the issue is and what the law was for. Or. Sometimes I think the democrats are more socialism. They seem to create more racial hatred in my opinion. Of course there's some republicans that can do that as well."
"111",2042307813,"The Republican's constantly use executive orders to pass their agenda. Given that it's the GOP who is circumventing voters rights, and slowly stripping away at our freedoms, I'm ok if Biden uses everything at his disposal to return our civil rights and pass bills that positively impact all citizens."
"112",2041922533,"Because the government should also be able to censor media outlets that attack Republicans more than Democrats. Honestly, media sources, especially news sources should keep opinions to themselves and just report the news. People can form their own opinions. They need not be told what to think by a news channel."
"113",2042568275,"If doing so is legally allowable, there seems to be no other choice but to govern through executive orders."
"114",2047156879,"Too many threats and political violence.Look what 'rump did on Twitter."
"115",2041659365,"because presidents of both parties have often issued executive orders to accomplish priorities which is a legal procedure."
"116",2041817325,"Because Republicans in congress hold hostage legislation forwarded to them simply to satisfy a republican party, no because it is a fair and just issue"
"117",2048698371,"Because the Republicans won't agree on anything the Democrats do. They block everything to go against the people."
"118",2041965683,"Most Republicans are not truthful. Brainwash their viewers like the hosts of Fox News. All full of BS. They should be fact checked on air as they are speaking. They twist everything to their liking."
"119",2042113091,"Because that's how the Republican president did it, and that was all fine, apparently."
"120",2043838443,"Because that is currently what the Republicans are doing."
"121",2043680235,"Because I would have voted for the Democratic president. I realize that this is kind of hypocritical, now that you point it out, but I was thinking in the terms of what we have now, with an democratic congress, and the rules of the senate allow the a minority to stop laws from going through. Also, executive orders are common, and have been used frequently."
"122",2041036831,"I think loyalty to the Democratic is important because if they do not agree than laws cannot be passed."
"123",2047170459,"It sure"
"124",2048669913,"Because the Democrats have been cheating in voting tallies."
"125",2041564213,"Because that's what the Democrats have been doing. Just look at Hillary Clinton!"
"126",2041165985,"If the party thinks and has reason to believe that the election has not been truthful and honest and fair, then I htink they should foloow their party."
"127",2043452543,"We are very fortunate to have so many freedoms. We can elect our government officials"
"128",2039982397,"I do not believe this to be true in every case, but there are instances in which the idea is so important it needs to be addressed. If the only way to address it is by executive order, then so be it. I believe we need to have a Congress and Senate willing to work across the aisle to accomplish great things. Sadly, that is not the sentiment held by most Senators and Representatives at this time."
"129",2051002283,"Because the media is very bias, it is obviously not very supportive of the the Republican party and always dawns over any Democrat they have on the air. It is not fair reporting, that is why I stopped watching the news."
"130",2043604169,"Because its partisan b.s. and bocking the president is not for the people. Go around it if necessary."
"131",2050389491,"The media must avoid biases."
"132",2043463097,"Because republicans have stated their purpose is to prevent democrats from passing anything. They have no purpose of working with democrats on anything."
"133",2041763459,"I don’t know"
"134",2043538889,"I stated that because sometimes you're not going to have the necessary support and you need a method of vetoing or circumventing some processes."
"135",2048912275,"no"
"136",2042399539,"Democrats are more likely to use executive orders for the good of their constituents. Republicans are more likely to use executive orders to benefit their personal interests. Selfishness is the foundation of the Republican Party."
"137",2043888899,"The media SHOULD be unbiased, so they shouldn't be attacking one party more than the other. They should only report the truth. However, when they don't report truth, and lean more one way or the other, they should be reigned in."
"138",2041955071,"I actually don't think that either party should consider ignoring court decisions wen the judges wo issued those decisions were appointed by either party"
"139",2043301703,"Because there are things that shoukd be properly investigated and heard. Being allowed to question how things were done is part of democracy. Many laws were changed in an instant, so questionable things happened"
"140",2047112889,"If they are playing politics and the President knows it is the right thing for the country."
"141",2047197977,"Because they always telling lies"
"142",2042387671,"There are exceptions to every rule and sensoring one sided media is one of them"
"143",2043610665,"I don't always agree with it, but sometimes it's necessary."
"144",2049687391,"For the past 4 election cycles the republicans has been the party of no to the majority of legislation proposed by democrats without any good reason. Until there is a change in electeds to those that are willing to work across the aisle executive orders are the way to accomplish anything"
"145",2043396107,"The President has that right to do so for the safety of this country. But does not have the right to use this authority for his own gain."
"146",2042163815,"Because the Republicans have a clear track record of believing in conspiracy theorist."
"147",2041409449,"The media should spend more time reporting the news and less time giving their bias opinions toward a certain candidate."
"148",2043386639,"Our ""representative democracy"" is deeply divided politically. If the opposition is constant to the president of either party, I believe the president should be able to issue executive orders within the rules, regulatios, and laws that allow executive orders, staying true to the constitution in all cases."
"149",2039359311,"Much of the media that attacks Democrats are using lies and misinformation. They are using their platform unfairly to influence their viewers and listeners."
"150",2047178319,"This was a mistake..I do not agree with it"
"151",2042099899,"the duly elected president is representative of the voting public. Republicans in congress have proven themselves willing to do anything to prevent a Democratic president from having success (Mitch McConnell is quoted saying as much), so in order to do the job he or she was elected to do, it has been necessary in recent years for Democratic presidents to use executive orders. It must be done within the strictures of the law."
"152",2040839431,"I don't think media should attack either party more than the other - if they use lies in doing it."
"153",2041791583,"Democrats in general are not conservative, much to the contrary."
"154",2045769435,"When Obama was elected, some Republican officials met in private and decided no matter the issue, they would not back the POTUS. I believe that they still do that and therfore there should be circumventing."
"155",2042614509,"Republican President Trump was corrupt"
"156",2044475979,"Because I don’t think it should be biased"
"157",2043386715,"I don't approve of anything Democrats do or say"
"158",2042181493,"Gerrymandering has skewed what should be representative democracy in favour of republicans. if we truly had a representative democracy, I would change my answer."
"159",2042425665,"Republican folks just don't like Democrats and President Obama has a very hard time getting things passed"
"160",2043569113,"Because party unity involving either party is important, they must back their own party"

"167",2040652177,"Although your questions are vague the reason I answered as i did: It is entirely possible that the candidate (Republican or Democrat) really has a leg to stand on to question the ballot count. Problems/mistakes do happen unfortunately in voter counts and recounts in the past have shown this. You don't roll over if you think you are right. Party members should stand behind each other, following the rules, until a TRUE decision has been made."
"168",2046248769,"Yes I should be easyer"
"169",2041638987,"Because the Republican Party of today is not interested in fairness and is in willing to work across the aisle with Democrats on anything and has become obstructionist. This is best demonstrated by the tactics which they used to pack the Supreme Court with a 6-3 majority. Mitch McConnell refused to even hold hearings when Merrick Garland was nominated saying that “the voters should get the opportunity to voice their opinion” even though the next presidential election was 8 months away. When Justice Ginsberg died in September of 2020 McConnell rushed Amy Coney Barrett’s nomination through in unprecedented fashion. Another example of this is the attempt by Donald Trump to steal the 2020 election from Joe Biden knowing that he had lost and the willingness of the majority of Republicans to go along with The Big Lie to retain their power regardless of the damage it has done to our democracy."
"170",2045882975,"Thank you pointing out my glaring constitutional faux pas. Honestly, I am not really sure I can logically explain my obvious contradiction except to say this: that a President's EO is not actually ""law"" and only lasts for the duration of his/her term, so it's only a temporary fix. Besides, if the EO is so controversial it can (and likely will) get challenged in court. Thus, the checks and balances of our representative government will be involved and will allow the EO to stand (because it is determined to be ""constitutional"") or not stand. Regardless, I am pretty sure it will still be a temporary fix until it is set in law by the legislative branch, whose job it is to pass laws. I hope this makes sense to someone. It actually does to me, I think."

"182",2043799961,"The media has been attacking Republicans especially since Trump became a president . The media has been censoring Republicans & trying to manipulate voters. This shouldn't be allowed to the extent it has been."
"183",2043838375,"I strongly agreed that If a Democratic president can't get cooperation from Republican members of congress to pass new laws, the Democratic president should circumvent Congress and issue executive orders on their own to accomplish their priorities, because Republicans in many cases will do anything to stonewall progressive policies under a Democratic president, and sometimes extreme measures are needed to pass important legislation concerning the environment, marginalized communities, and economic reform."
"184",2048939705,"Because Republicans have cheated by gerrymandering voting districts and limiting/cutting early voting. Also, the Electoral College should be abolished since it is an anachronism."
"185",2041400813,"The power of executive orders is limited in scope and duration. For example, the President cannot change tax laws. I will go further,, because of gerrymandering, the outsized effect of Senate representation favoring rural states and the Republican control of the Supreme Court it's not exactly structurally representative to begin with. Executive orders are not dictatorial."
"186",2043546191,"Because the issuance of executive orders are legal in the United States. There’s only so much a President can do with executive orders, but as long as he/she is operating within the law, I think a Democratic AND a Republican President is within their rights to issue executive orders, at least until the laws are changed."

"192",2043615327,"While I agree that a representative democracy is ideal, I also recognize that our government has to function. My hope would be that the president and Congress would work together. If that's not happening then I think the president should circumvent Congress."

"194",2049382361,"Democratic presidents typically have the majority of Americans values in mind and would pass laws to benefit the majority of Americans.

"197",2043518763,"as is now i feel neither republican and democrats reallydont take us into consideration, all they do is fight"
"198",2048476619,"Because that President was elected by the people to represent them. Republican members of congress learned from Gingrich that it's more important to stop laws written by Democrats than it is to compromise and find the middle ground.

"199",2042513097,"Sometimes with the Democrat party it depends on who the president is and not what the new laws that are trying to be passed. It shouldn't make a difference who the president is. Sometimes it is just spite."
"200",2042573925,"The filibuster. It isn’t even in the Constitution. If a majority supports the effort but it cannot pass because of filibuster gridlock, the President should act. If the majority oppose, President should refrain. But filibuster needs to permanently go."

"203",2042451055,"the bias and hype that sometimes comes from media can stir persons with ideas should not be there. yes we have the God given right to make our own decisions, unfortunately some people think the media is the gospel and let's face it - whomever is reporting AT THAT TIME it's their truth not necessarily THE truth..."

"212",2041988733,"If Republican members have valid reasons for opposing the new laws that a Democratic president wants to pass, then I don't believe that the POTUS should circumvent Congress. However, the current Republican Congresspeople are opposing anything and everything just for the sake of gridlock. If nothing is getting done, then the Republicans will and are blaming it on the Democrats. An example is Matt Gaetz voting no on emergency aid to Florida following the latest hurricane. He would rather his constituents suffer, than ""give Joe Biden a win"". In a situation like this, then I believe in the POTUS circumventing the Congress."
"213",2041001099,"Yes because all of us have the right for the rules and constitution."

(Whereas under Bush and even Trump, Democrats did not have the same straight line purity test voting box behavior.) Many important issues, such as student loan relief, gun control, environmental protection, and women’s healthcare access are related to executive branch offices, and to the degree that they are properly related to these offices, the president should use their properly granted authority to fight for the policies they were elected to enact. This becomes even more important when tactics like the filibuster and gerrymandered districts are overused to the point where the executive branch more accurately reflects the popular vote than the Congress."
"217",2044440855,"Because republicans back eachother up even if they personally disagree. They have this ride or die god complex that itsnt right. Republicans wouldn’t back up a democrat unless they get some personal gain from it where democrats are just thinking of what’s best for the American people"
"218",2043225603,"Yes"

"240",2047078729,"Representative democracy is the best thing we've got but is far from a perfect system, especially given gerrymandering and the disproportionate power of low-population states in the Senate. Executive orders should be used carefully, and it's important to remember that they are not as lasting as getting legislation passed, but can be entirely appropriate as a response to urgent problems in the face of legislative logjams."
"241",2041845291,"There are more media sources that attack republicans"
"242",2041402893,"I think the government should sensor amedia attacks on both parties, however that question was not asked if me and a different question was asked and phrased differently."
"243",2051390271,"Yes, the government should impose its censorship on the media and on many other things. This is a good thing and makes it do its job excellently"
"244",2042399535,"I think a democracy is very important but I also don’t think that any media should spend time attacking anybody. Wether your t be Democrat or republican. The media should report the facts and stop with all the negative attacks. Not only is it mud slinging but it is defamatory and can be very misleading to the public and cause undue discord"
"245",2042547729,"Simply because the rules of the elections and the constitution are breached by the other party in the elections, and there may be evidence of this penetration. In this case, loyalty to the party is the master of judgments."

"252",2046657091,"A media source is intended to represent the news; the facts of what is occurring, the evidence of what they see. Especially in our current reality, as opposed to a hypothetical perfect world existing in a vacuum, a media source today that spends more time attacking Democrats than Republicans is displaying an alternate reality being dictated by foreign donors and hostile governments. They are spreading deliberate disinformation and propaganda, and should be censored to prevent public acts of political and social violence."

"263",2043453839,"The US currently is a representative democracy in name only. Due to the nature of the Senate, smaller states are given more power than larger states in the upper house. This was supposed to be corrected for by making the house of representatives, but in the early 20th century the number of reps in the house was capped, further reducing the power of larger states. Now that the country is more polarized than ever, there is a distinct lack of power at the federal level given to large states which tend to vote Democratic. The president can act as a check on this anti democratic system (note the large D vs small d democrats)"

"269",2042175929,"I think that"
"270",2042161977,"It actually depends upon what the law is. Also, the Republican party is becoming more and more extreme and I believe this will make it more likely that a Democratic President will not be able to accomplish much during their term. Also, this is a loaded question. There are so many variables at play. Like I stated above, what is the law?; What type of Democratic President do we have in office? Is it someone like AOC or someone more moderate like Manchin."
"271",2049295079,"because the media is biased against the Republican party , but i also think that the electoral process is extremely important if it is done fairly and justly."

"273",2048262367,"It depends on the policy"
"274",2050872013,"Because they should stick together"
"275",2042171763,"Republican representatives have admitted to their commitment to obstructing Democratic presidents, including not even granting Supreme Court nominees a hearing. If Republicans were not so committed to simply blocking everything Democrats attempted to do, without even a discussion or vote, my answer regarding executive orders would have been different."

"278",2041856187,"Executive orders are issued in every administration. If the Congress ignores the will of the people just to obstruct the functioning of the government, then they are not a representative democracy to the United States, just to the party that they represent. Hence, I have no issue with an executive order and do not see this as being hypocritical."
"279",2050253363,"Sometimes the republican might not agree with the decision due to not been in same party."
"280",2042293417,"We also elect the president and executive orders are nowhere near as strong as laws so if the next president comes in they can reverse whatever they want.

When decisions are made by Republican judges, exceptions The Supreme Court, most of the time the republican judge is ignored. I feel if the order issued is biased, which in my opinion democrats are extremely biased yet project their bias on Republicans. I feel if the democrats can get away with ignoring republican judges then republican can do the same. I used to consider myself a independent I've voted for both parties including President Bill Clinton. I'm throughly, to be honest, throughly disappointed and disgusted with the democratic party especially since the 2020 Portland riots with Govenor Kate Brown encouraged the rioters."

"305",2053038123,"There should be fairness in how the media reports the news but the media has been very biased and heavily supports the Democrats. They are obedient to the Democrat Party.

"308",2052533419,"All of the mainstream media companies spend more time attacking Republicans than Democrats. I think we need a fair media coverage. Trump was a far superior President to the current one, but the mainstream media never covered it that way."
"309",2054323587,"Governmental success hinges on cooperation. If vital laws are being blocked by the opposing side simply for the sake of creating trouble for the party in power and callously ignoring the needs of Americans (such as during the height of the COVID crisis), then yes, as a last resort a president could circumvent Congress and issue executive orders. Your question format did not allow for explaining that I would agree to this as a last resort."

"311",2051788241,"The Republican party is obstructionist and will do everything in there power to stop the Democratic party from implementing anything"
"312",2053785633,"Republican politicians these days are almost completely obstructionist even about sensible policies that are not partisan (e.g., the federal debt ceiling, taxing the super wealthy, believing in elections that are fair). They are willing to take the US as a whole hostage in order to get what they want, and have done so several times already in the recent past (e.g., shutting down the federal government). As long as what the Democratic president issues as executive orders are fully legal, or legally defensible on solid legal grounds, I don't see why getting bipartisan acceptance in itself is a worthy goal -- given the extremism of the Republicans these days. Trump declared the construction of the border wall at the Mexican border a ""national emergency"" and thereby circumvented Congress. Was this legal? I doubt it. If a Democractic president declared that global climate change is a national emergency, as long as he can provide solid legal support for this executive order, I don't see why such a president needs to get cooperation from the Republicans. All US presidents in recent decades, in both parties, have issued executive orders because Congress s gridlocked. This way of doing things is not ideal, of course, but neither are such orders permanent anyway because they expire once a presidency ends."

"321",2052025209,"It is in my opinion Republicans purposely refuse to accept anything that a Democratic president puts forth. Democrats, on the other hand, respect both a Democratic idea and a Republican idea, and fairly accept what is put before them in the interest of our country. They do not have to be the winners at all cost. They look out for the welfare of our country. The Republicans, in my opinion, look out for their party."
"322",2052736287,"The filibuster in the senate gives too much control to the minority party. Thus, we are not working with a real representative democracy"
"323",2057198063,"Because 90% of the media spends more time attacking Republicans. It's conspiracy, collusion and its ENOUGH ALREADY."
"324",2054332457,"Republicans are almost never representative of their precincts"
"325",2056228175,"False dilemma. Executive orders are just as much a function of our representative democracy as are federal regulations of all sorts. They are limited to the administration who authors them and can be litigated if found to be illegal. Stop using dichotomous descriptions when the mechanisms are far more complex."
"326",2056281679,"Democrats practice party loyalty, depending some election rules/laws and the constitution some states of the Nation, whereas Republicans have lately tried to limit voter's rights even before the election results are (finalized) reported to the public."
"327",2052735241,"Regardless of party, it is sometimes necessary for the President to use executive orders in order to get anything done. In this day of extreme polarization and Congress people voting in lockstep with their party, it is almost impossible to get any meaningful legislation passed. If this doesn't change soon, Democratic presidents will have to use executive orders in order to save the environment."
"328",2052055377,"Because right now it's acceptable for the media to attack Republicans without any fear of reprisals."
"329",2052703969,"Over the past several decades Republicans have become spiteful, rather than the loyal opposition. In attempting to benefit the vast majority of citizens, a Democratic president may have to create executive orders to achieve his/her priorities for the good of the country. If left to a Republican congress, there would be no voting rights, EPA, COVID response, etc."
"330",2059166289,"Because our media today are nothing more than mouthpieces for the Democratic Party. It’s unfair and they won’t listen to reason."
"331",2052026797,"Unfortunately, Republicans appear to be deadset on obstruction. Yes, I want to live in a representative democracy -- absolutely. Executive orders come from a president who was duly elected by a representative democracy. When the only response of the opposition is to obstruct, then I think it is within reason for there to be executive orders issued. They can be changed at any time, they can be overridden by courts, and they can be a vehicle for eliciting some compromise."
"332",2057340717,"I trust a Republican to look out for the whole of the country more than a Democrat."
"333",2052087123,"It is a back-and-forth thing. Democrats usually get their wishes granted if put in that position by Democrat President. The same works well for the Republicans if put in office by a Republican President. Just the way it is."
"334",2051701085,"1. That's what executive orders are for. 2. Republican presidents have used them more than Democrats have. 3. Democrats' executive orders are more likely to be for the good of the country. 4. Republican legislators (Boehner, McConnell, McCarthy) are more likely to obstruct Democratic presidents' initiatives just to keep him from being successful."
"335",2052139011,"It is not unconstitutional to issue executive orders especially when the opposing party has a mandate of obstruction to any proposed legislation regardless of its merit."
"336",2053773205,"Because the Republican Senate Leader, Mitch McConnell has said that his party should do anything they need to do to make the President fail. The president was elected by all of the people, Mitch McConnell was not. He was elected only in Kentucky and doesn’t represent all Americans, or their concerns."
"337",2051740775,"Only in cases where the opposition is 100% obstructionist"
"338",2056521085,"It seems as if democratic Presidents are often too vicious - will not consider anything republican. The anti-Trump venom is a pretty good example of that venom."
"339",2056298659,"Some times Republicans can be too stubborn"
"340",2053891583,"Because sometimes the decked is stacked against the Democrats. Such as when they pushed through Amy Coney Barrett for Supreme Court. When Obama was the president recall how they sidelined Merrick Garland"
"341",2053606247,"The Democrats have tried to fight the Republications every way they can. The media very obviously support the Democrats and are biased against the Republicans. You can't believe anything the media says or publishes."
"342",2059375501,"Because the media pretty much works with the democrats. The media has been biased for years."
"343",2059333103,"The main stream media is owned by liberals. Republicans are always the target of the media. There is no restriction when it comes to Democrats and what they can do or say. Facebook is a perfect example of GOP censorship."
"344",2060041969,"Because since Newt Gingrich in the '90s, Republicans have been more interested in observing Democrats than working too make the country better. Obstructing for obstructing sake is not what legislators we elected to do. So sometimes it's necessary for the President to issue executive orders to move the country forward, actions that are perfectly legal. It's not only don't on a federal level, but at the state level as well."
"345",2058989701,"Because the Democrats are far too left and liberal."
"346",2056217285,"I don’t approve of the media attacking politicians"
"347",2052633665,"Because it sways elections by labeling things like Hunter Biden's laptop and Joe Biden's collusion and kickbacks a disinformation and lets media be activists instead of investigative journalists. I am sick of nothing nice being said about patriotic conservatives and protecting the puppet in office who is a marionette of Obama's Socialist destruction of the U.S. The media are useful idiots."
"348",2053843051,"Where there are questionable circumstances, such as in the 2020 election. (Ballots under tables counted after hours in Georga, votes in Pennsylvania deducted from the Republican and added to the Democrat on live TV, undated ballot box stuffing.) Those things should be explained openly in the eye of the people who are questioning it."
"349",2057523645,"In the past both parties worked together to resolve differences and pass legislation that benefited the American people. Sadly, those days no longer exist. Since taking office President Biden has faced opposition to laws that he has wanted to pass, among these are the lowering of prescription drug costs. This law benefits Americans by providing significant savings on prescription drugs including the cost of insulin. It also allows Medicare to negotiate drug prices. Without Executive action this bill may not have passed as no Republican voted for it. This is an example of the President circumventing Congress on behalf of the American people."
"350",2061632209,"Democrats would often resist cooperating with a Republican President out of sheer political interest, NOT for the general good of the country and in those cases, the Republican President needs to do what is right for the country"
"351",2052086223,"As long as it is legal and Constitutional, the Executive Branch can exercise its designated rights...but nothing beyond that."
"352",2054666557,"Read the Constitution"
"353",2057570885,"The president should work as hard as he can with congress to get laws and his agenda done. But if you have a congress that is absolutely against working with a president then the president must use executive orders. But that’s only in extreme circumstances where congress won’t work with the president"
"354",2049986471,"I feel that way because unfortunately it appears to be the only way to get some things accomplished. When the opposing party consistently votes against whatever progress they're hoping to achieve just because they're on opposite sides of the aisle, nothing ever gets accomplished. I don't necessarily agree that executive orders are a good thing, it feels like every time a new president from the opposite side gets in, they issue a rash of executive orders to try to erase as much as possible as what their predecessor put into place."
"355",2053786401,"The last administration has a lot to do with attitudes of people the way they used the courts (they appointed) to get things they wanted."
"356",2053214865,"I think that executive orders should only apply for very important short term problems."
"357",2058234753,"Republicans always try to do something scheming"
"358",2055614479,"I think I misunderstood the question, as I see that my answer does contradict the question."
"359",2057941031,"At the rate the Supreme Court is becoming political, I think some of there decisions should be ignored"
"360",2053832391,"I don’t believe that either side should be able to air false or misleading ads. All ads should be scrutinized in fairness for the truth and not disparaging differing ideas."
"361",2058672315,"Republicans do not want to work with Democrats on anything, so democrates if they wish to get anything accomplished should issue executive orders"
"362",2056024459,"It depends on the law. Example, COVID vaccinations. If Republicans do not want vaccinations the Democratic president has a right to pass the law that everyone should get vaccinated."
"363",2053038025,"This is a very bias question, considering the current democrat president routinely bypasses congress,so the same rules should apply to both democrats and republicans"
"364",2055486959,"This statistically skews the poll results."
"365",2058261793,"Because the courts and federal government are controlled by Democrats and the only hope of correcting any of these issues is by speaking with one voice."
"366",2052082369,"because the media is almost totally biased against conservative ideas and values and opinions"
"367",2051986233,"Because the Dems are destroying this country and Republicans must do what ever it takes to stop them!!! And by the way we live in a Constitutional Republic!"
"368",2052736265,"As the country gets destroyed by Biden/Obama/Soros, we can see the results of the last election. Republicans did not back their candidate in many instances. Biden has an approval rating of just over 40%, Republicans should have won more sears, but the party was not backing their own candidates."
"369",2054025053,"because right is right and the left is on the wring track"
"370",2050101767,"To me that would be part of a representative democracy that is why it is a legitimate option. Trump certainly used it."
"371",2049987377,"Unfortunately we do live in a representative democracy today. When Biden took office and wrote a multitude of Executive Orders and has completely ignored our constitution. Democrat appointed judges have consistently ruled against Republicans, so I cannot say we live in a representative democracy. I call them as I see them! We need a massive change to get this country back to representative democracy!"
"372",2055328923,"It depends on the circumstances. I also agreed that the democrats should stand behind their man if they question the election results."
"373",2056058229,"Media should be neutral..They should iild not be attacking anyone. If they cannot come to this conclusion on their own they need to be regulated"
"374",2053214905,"Yes because the opposite ishappeningnow"
"375",2060546223,"Because it's already happening. The majority of the mainstream media outlets are biased against Republicans."
"376",2055570761,"Because the Republicans in Congress defy anything Democrats do. Republicans in Congress are simply there for power and nothing about the people matters at all."
"377",2055885543,"As with todays gop party nothing would get accomplished as they will not agree to anything the Dems. do. The only way to do it is with executive orders If the congress were to EVER work for the American people and be bi-partisan then you would not need the executive orders. As it stands now nothing will get done. The gop cares nothing about the POTUS agenda or the American people."
"378",2052533737,"I think that when congress divides itself strictly along party lines, nothing at all will be done without executive orders. For example, I think SCOTUS should be ""unstacked"" by executive order"
"379",2054133697,"The Repub party doesn’t care about the average working class and will try to pass laws that benefit the wealthy and the only way for a Dem is to issue executive orders"
"380",2058326811,"depends on the issue at hand,"
"381",2051668313,"Because this is what Presidents do. Obama said something like 'HE HAS A PEN AND A WILL RULE BY EXECUTIVE ORDER. Don't act like it's only Republican who do this. Biden has issued more Execute Orders and any other President. This is a very biased survey and very obvious conducted by way left wing Democrats."
"382",2050062977,"No matter what party is in power, if it is stonewalling on passing laws that would benefit the American people and enhance adherence to the Constitution, (instead of giving preference to entitled people like giving tax cuts for the rich), then I think it would be justification enough for the President with his/her limited power to issue an executive order in keeping with the intent of our founding Fathers."
"383",2052706581,"Our system of checks and balances should allow circumventing stalemates, with the court system assuring fairness through its oversight"
"384",2053835951,"Because that’s what Democrat Presidents ALWAYS do and I’m tired of Republicans playing by the rules while Democrats don’t. Executive orders can always be undone by the next President."
"385",2056100579,"one has nothing to do with the other. the media has become an arm of the DNC and hides information from the public that would hurt DIms in an election cycle I.E. hunters laptop and Bidens beholden to the russian and chinese govt."
"386",2054844533,"Until Pres Trump I had lost faith in gov't. I believed they were worldwide bullies. The Dems proved they were bullies during the Trump and he was forced to writ EO's for the Good of America."
"387",2058004869,"Censoring anyone's voice, regardless of party, should not be allowed. Everyone should have the same rights of free speech. Also, America is not a representative democracy, as much as the media tells us, America is a representative republic. People of this country need to go back & read what the founding father's wrote instead of just listening to what social media & the woke media tell them. Democracy is just another word for socialism."
"388",2054245189,"Because democrats never want to consider anything republicans want to do"
"389",2053073093,"Na"
"390",2056402529,"I am not sure but I think media should stay out of it"
"391",2056808773,"I don’t know"
"392",2055513687,"Because the democrats are very corrupt and immoral and they think it is okay if they cheat to win a election like the 2020 election. They also do not want to cooperate with Republicans and resist them when ever they have a chance"
"393",2053752229,"The media should be unbiased"
"394",2053503743,"Because that's what they all do."
"395",2058260149,"Democratic has did one hell of a job he straighten out the othr president failed to do his job he was in it for victory of some shit for himself not for the people we made America great again after the ex president mess everything up"
"396",2054669475,"Because it is time to break the gridlock that has paralyzed our government for more than 20 years. There is no statesmanship anymore. No compromise. When that happens - extreme measures need to be taken to move agendas along."
"397",2057901895,"If republicans actually denounced MAGA, and denounced the domestic terrorist groups, I would not support it. But unfortunately it’s not possible to have a logical choice with them. When their entire agenda is to block democracy, our way of life is hanging in the balance."
"398",2052507739,"I believe the government should not pick sides so if either Republicans or Democrats were being attacked unequally and unfairly, the government should get involved.."
"399",2056214569,"If you remember history, President Barack Obama did that very thing he wrote a lot of executive orders in the very end. Now it took executive orders from President Trump to override those executive orders so what’s good for a goose is good for a gander."
"400",2054175331,"The number of polling stations EVERYWHERE should be reduced, regardless of area."
"401",2059292131,"Why not be equal? If you are not going to censor democrats why do you feel it is ok to censor republicans?"
"402",2052703953,"The current bunch of insurrectionists posing as Republicans haveonly one agenda as stated by Mitch McConnell stop Biden's agenda at all costs. Desperate times require desperate measures."
"403",2055648693,"As long as the law and constitution are fallowed . Both can do it ."
"404",2051893425,"Each party should be called out for wrong doing, not attacked. It should not be partisan."
"405",2053497799,"The President, regardless of party affiliation has the right to do just that, circumvent opposition from an opposing party because. the President believes in what he is doing is in the best interests of the nation. Political parties have their own agenda as to what is beneficial to their own party, not the country as a whole. That is the role of the POTUS, to make a final judgement on issues such as national security, health issues of the general public as we saw with the pandemic and vaccine usage."
"406",2059946341,"greay better"
"407",2052938103,"If Congress doesn't take action on an issue the current President should have the right to resolve the issue with an executive order. Congress should also have a way to resolve the executive order if it proves to be a bad decision."
"408",2054406337,"There are higher rates of physical violence coming from Republicans. They are encouraged to attack any Democrat by Republican leaders. The Democrats rarely attack Republicans as there is less rhetoric coming from Democratic leaders. Two big examples, January 6th and Paul Pelosi attack."
"409",2059363305,"If you recall we watched that take place when President Obama was in off. In fact Republican Senators (Mitch McConnell) said he would do nothing to help or cooperate with President Obama. In fact a statement was made by him that he wanted President Obama to fail and to make him a (1) term president."
"410",2057537191,"I, firmly believe, that the election for President in 2022 was stolen from the Republicans and President Trump. Democrats were able to rig this election with help from the big media giants and possibly, China. The people we elect should work for us, not themselves, as Democrats are doing and have done for a long time. Some Republicans are guilty of the same thing, although. Democrats are ignoring the Constitution as written to the point that they want to get rid of the filibuster. Having said this, the Democrats aren't abiding to rule of law."
"411",2052940257,"Part of the reason a president is elected is because his priorities line up with the voters. Sometimes when Congress is deadlocked in partisanship and all efforts to find common agreement on an issue fail, it is necessary for the POTUS to move forward within legal and constitutional boundaries."
"412",2059487405,"If, in a Democracy, the voice of the citizens are priority, the government should hold the power."
"413",2055474799,"It's the only way to drain the swamp, and a much higher percentage of Democrats are swamp creatures than not."
"414",2053699881,"Because Republicans are against anything the democrats put forth, no matter what. It's not American to be this way."
"415",2053698837,"I trust a Democratic president to do the right thing and only circumvent congress when it is for the good of the nation"
"416",2059639855,"don't know"
"417",2056265237,"I like to live in a democracy but the Democratic Party is destroying this country and the people are getting poorer every day. I support the Republicans 100% because their laws support the interests of citizens"
"418",2056333331,"Here is the way I feel about the democrats order is that are not for the Americans , I feel like that because they lie, change our rule to where we become the poorest country and that China would become the rulers"
"419",2052738447,"Because the democratic president we have now is mentally deficient. Hopefully a Republican president would be a much better choice than the sicko we have now."
"420",2059250077,"I think it's a trick question although I don't think Republicans are ridiculous in their way of thinking"
"421",2041921705,"The entire platform of the Republican party is to say NO to everything the Democrats want , they have made it very clear that they have become the party of NO, and they seem to think this is a strategy they want to follow, election denial, no climate change, Trump really won- so insanity is not how government gets done...so that leaves not a lot of options ..look at the Supreme Court which now has zero credibility due to Republican blocking Obama and rushing a last minute nominee on what grounds? I am a registered Republican but the party left me behind and became insane. And no hw about a nationwide ban on abortion? Seriously who is running that idea..not a Democrat."
"422",2053301629,"Because the Republican party has stalemated every bill President Biden has tried to pass."
"423",2052703857,"The government should be able to censor all media sources for biased reporting."
"424",2056299447,"A Democratic president is more likely to do something for the greater good while a Republican president would be more like to do something for personal or party gain."
"425",2053929459,"It works both ways. BUT it would be better if there was an in depend group to do the work"
"426",2051782707,"As a veteran both parties should be treated equally and unbiased per the constitution."
"427",2052801161,"Republicans are not always reasonable. They disagree just to be disagreeable."
"428",2056847399,"Sometimes the Republicans just don't want to be representative or democratic. They focus instead on opposing anything and everything a Democrat attempts, even to a point of near complete destruction of the government. When that happens, the President has a choice: Get something productive done, or don't."
"429",2058378055,"I want our government to function and for congress and the president to work together to find middle ground. If congress is refusing to cooperate, I think the president should be able to issue (repealable) orders to help the country."
"430",2058333899,"Because those court decisions were made with partisan pettiness in mind."
"431",2052738347,"Because Republicans are not playing by the rules, they are not willing to cooperate, they simply stonewall, They voted down numerous bills that would benefit needy Americans and veterans. They aren't willing to help protect our water, air & food. They are dangerous to our heath and to our earth."
"432",2055665849,"Because the curent Republican party is almost totally partisan. Their goal seems to be to stonewall any progress made by a Democratic president even if it's beneficial to the people. So issuing executive is the only way to make any progress."
"433",2050048549,"If it is a serious issue then as president he should have that right"
"434",2055969561,"I agreed because if polls show that the American people want the President to pass a bill or law and they are not agreeing with the majority and dont want to pass something just because the Presidents is from across party lines."
"435",2060600623,"I didn't say that!"
"436",2053008079,"Because the republicans have made it impossible to get anything passed that the democrats present"
"437",2053389667,"should be no censorship no matter which party it is"
"438",2052533507,"It should be fair to both sides"
"439",2054406243,"I think that this group of republicans we have now are so very extreme and are not willing to work with our democratic president. A representaive democracy is very important but when the republicans cannot work together at all with the democrats and go to great lengths to say no to everything then I feel a democratic president should within good reason issue executive orders. Lets be real here also, the democratic side is more willing to work with the republicans and sadly the republicans are no no no to almost everything."
"440",2059855183,"Because they're too right wing to even follow the law"
"441",2059978013,"yes"
"442",2052706211,"I'm am sick of the bias media"
"443",2059335303,"because the media leans toward the democrat side almost always and will not cover stories that show democrat crimes like bidens son . they have more stories about trump to make him look bad."
"444",2052908475,"In all honesty, the Republican Party is scaring me right now. I feel they are violating womens rights, pushing the idea that elections are stolen and we can’t forget Jan 6th which I believe was incited by our Republican president at the time. My answer is hypocritical but I think times are scary right now."
"445",2052739765,"No I didn’t say that"
"446",2052691631,"Attacking anyone in the United States in any way. It should not be allowed to be a part of regular news."
"447",2052879871,"I feel there is no reason to attack Democrats or Republicans and you can live in a democracy by doing this. Treat others the way you want to be treated."
"448",2054018627,"Because the media do nothing but attack the republicans the coverage is so biased its laughable, nearly every show on cable tv is about race, gay,LBQT issues and i can barely stand to watch tv i'm actually thinking of stopping Tv service completely it has gotten so bad"
"449",2049986157,"Republicans lie. During their hearings Supreme Court nominees said they would respect Roe v Wade. Once they were on the court they voted to overturn abortion."
"450",2055949315,"THE LIBERALS CRY AND EXPECT THE POEPLE THAT FEAR GOD TO BE QUIT"
"451",2052740157,"When stalemate is as prevalent as it is now extraordinary measures are sometimes needed."
"452",2052844557,"Biden's student loan forgiveness program was on my mind and thought that was a good decision on Biden's part. If the program goes through is it really going to harm someone? I was thinking of Trump and the Republicans being in bed with the NRA and how they won't give an inch on having any gun laws. If the Republicans stance with guns continues will it harm someone? Yes. Lots of people. I answered with emotion because I get mad at the Republicans because their stance on issues harm people."
"453",2061171617,"Because while it's great to live in a country where everyone gets a say in decisions that affects us as a country. It is also important to respect each others choices and that means no hate toward the opposite party."
"454",2053261399,"I chose the wrong statement accidentally."
"455",2055841817,"It was OK when Trump did this so why shouldn't a Democratic President be allowed to do the same? However, I believe doing this should be based on the type of legislation, will it benefit all US citizens, and why the Republicans don't want to pass this law."
"456",2056325145,"I have faith that a Democratic president will only use EOs when the issue is very very important. An example is the DACA children. I don't think children should be torn from a country they were often born and raised in even if their parents are here illegally. If the Republicans won't pass a bill to help these children, I think it's good that an EO to written to help them."
"457",2054174397,"We should always petition the courts and local law to ensure that every vote it counted, across the aisle. I'm a licensed attorney and feel strongly about this"
"458",2058309527,"It is not undemocratic to question the results of an election. This question was worded inappropriately in that it suggested that being loyal to a candidate who questions an election is undemocratic, or unconstitutional. This is a very biased question."
"459",2058283619,"Even the playing field, republicans do it all the time. In a perfect world I wouldn't."
"460",2056115405,"The media is very biased towards Republicans. There needs to be no more bias in the media. They are getting paid to report facts, not feelings."
"461",2053613129,"Most tv news station are owned by liberals"
"462",2058933557,"I misunderstood the question. I thought it meant that the other party members should support the party but not the member who questions"
"463",2059363373,"Because in the past Dems including Obama and biden have done just That, ""I have a pen"" !"
"464",2056568225,"Because the republicans always think they are right about everything they talk about"
"465",2052104393,"If one party or another refuses to even discuss or engage, then there are times when the interest and needs of the country outweigh it. This is true for both parties. There is a need to govern even when one party opts out of the process purely for partisan reasons."
"466",2052902435,"We should all be trying to work together to better our country. Attacking people doesn't help solve the problem."
"467",2054049821,"Republicans are generally wrong and also, dramatic"
"468",2056461439,"I think it has been proven very harmful when some media allows lies to be represented as truth. Our current society believes the deception that has been spread. I believe if a tv station calls itself a news outlet it should be reporting honestly and not lies and held accountable for the harm. As for social media...we should have regulations and rules and I personally would prefer no politics at all, and no hateful behavior on social media."
"469",2058622391,"Is very important to be able to vote so we can have the right to speech"
"470",2060928385,"Mejor ideas"
"471",2055470815,"A Republican president has a mandate, no less important than that of Democrat Congressional Representatives. Given current and persistent anti-American predilections of today's Democrat Party, whose members are less likely to abide by the U.S. Constitution or the rule of law, a Republican President, like Republican state governors are the last best agencies to stop or mitigate harmful Leftist radicalism."
"472",2052742129,"I personally think the Democrats need that extra help at times. It’s almost like a love hate rivalry between Republicans and Democrats I think government should be fair and come up with a new plan"
"473",2053539623,"dont know"
"474",2048218173,"When the Republican Party is obstructing every priority that a Democratic President has for strictly political reasons rather than the benefit of the issue, he has no choice."
"475",2053609355,"None"
"476",2052842015,"They should enact executive orders that are lawful"
"477",2055850295,"I don't know"
"478",2058542953,"because democrats have there own agenda to ruin the middle class"
"479",2055545225,"Unfortunately I answered the way I did because I think that if it were a Republican president, they would circumvent Congress. I think unfortunately that Democrats will need to be just as dirty as the Republicans are on a daily basis. I'm also afraid that if the Republicans get control of our government, that they will never give up that control."
"480",2057041247,"I only agreed that a Democratic president should circumvent Congress if Republican members of Congress do not agree mainly because it was done in the last Presidential election. If it is okay for the previous presidents to issue executive orders, then the current Democratic president should be able to do the same as well."
"481",2052975039,"Because by behaving that way, the Republican members of Congress are blocking the progress of the representative democracy and the constituents they are supposed to be representing by not cooperating. Also, the President has executive rights, and that means being able to issue executive orders when they deem appropriate."
"482",2052689053,"Because we live in a time we're hack judges appointed by clown face Trump can let him get away with crimes and write clearly misguided rulings clearly in his favor. Why should we have to abide by racist corrupt judges who favor criminals?"
"483",2061820909,"Even though we live in a representative democracy, the electoral college fails to elect the presidents who have the majority vote from the public. Therefore, if the president wasn't the people's choice, then his orders don't need to be followed."
"484",2051901055,"He would be a lame duck president and not be able to work for the people that put him in office. It is important that he be able to do his job."
"485",2052688015,"What is the point of presidency if they can’t do anything for 2-4 years?"
"486",2052084753,"It seems to be the only way the democrats understand, that is proper force by a true elected republican president that is trying to help 100 percent of Americans while they do not want any proper help as democtats....a sad situation that is tearing apart our beautiful country...Just like they want....sad. sad. sad"
"487",2058355901,"Because the reason for not cooperating is non politics, just being nasty ,gop is for gop even if it's best for the people ,if it's a great idea from the democratic party and not idea from the gop ,even if the idea is great they don't want the people thinking the democratic party might actually be working for them instead of against"
"488",2057701437,"I didn't understand the question . The government should not be able to censor media sources that spend more time attacking Democrats than Republicans."
"489",2054206325,"Nothing will ever get done in this country. Like now, nothing ever gets done. We talk about the same thing year after year, and it is the same old thing."
"490",2059737279,"If congress can't get anything done, make their rules"
"491",2053110669,"A two-party system is very important for a democracy. However, when you have a Republican party that refuses to work with the president on passing bills or even bringing them up for a vote, then in order to achieve goals it is sometimes necessary for the president to issue executive orders."
"492",2055509369,"Republicans obstruct any and all measures from the Democrats even if it is for the common good. The obstruction is deliberate and applies only to Democrat proposed laws."
"493",2050002929,"This has been the way the Government has run all my life. Executive orders are generally temporary and are commonly cancelled by the next incoming administration. Plus there is a limitation as to what executive orders can be used for and if they are not constitutional that's what the Supreme court is for when it's working properly."
"494",2056598113,"because of the current political climate and past practice by republicans"
"495",2059293431,"Some laws may be great, but , because a different party suggests it, the other party will say no, then nothing gets done."
"496",2059901701,"If there's evidence of voter fraud."
"497",2052140531,"Because, right vote for equal for Republicans and Democrats, there are others topics to answer to our country."
"498",2051780831,"Because the GOP are reactionary, regressive and recalcitrant"
"499",2058234191,"They should establish what they can"
"500",2056320597,"Because it may be very important for the people needs and have to be done."
"501",2060437177,"Too many news media are totally bias towards republican parties and not reporting actual accounts, just their personal opinions."
"502",2052707159,"Because we need to think of the overall public good. This can,exist in a representative democracy, but that's not the case right now. Republicans care nothing about the public good."
"503",2059966561,"Because Republicans have gerrymandered Congress and the courts, so this isn't really a representative Democracy, as there are many more Democrats than Republicans in the country, but there are more Republicans in the House, the Governorships and the Supreme Court, plus barely a minority in the Senate."
"504",2055602615,"Some decisions are clearly evident that they favor politics over the constitution."
"505",2058309297,"When there has been very serious problems with elections that are not addressed but swept under the rug than a candidate has every right to dispute the election and bring forth their evidence."
"506",2057074013,"I didn't necessarily agree. I thought I chose the ""neither agree nor disagree"" choice. And I only chose that because I feel like if a media outlet is constantly relaying false information (which I guess is not always just attacking democrats) it should have some consequences."
"507",2055970131,"We have to go by rules"
"508",2052744813,"Because some laws are just wrong. For instance the ban against abortion if just wrong. Women should be able to do whatever they want with their body. I would be happy if POTUS signed an executive order to make abortion legal."
"509",2057189977,"Because several Democrats would disagree with any executive order given by a Republican just because it was given by a Republican. Even if better for our country, Democrats don't seem to want to help our country. They have given us higher gas prices, inflation, etc. Nothing that actually helps the country."
"510",2055513719,"That depends what the issues are. It shouldn’t be done all the time on a whim. For example. Seniors are hurting desperately Republicans won’t send financial aid to seniors. Then the president should have executive order"
"511",2053171981,"Because Republicans are fascists"
"512",2052023889,"Executive orders aren't necessarily permanent"
"513",2059411871,"Yes"
"514",2052538543,"I only believe this in certain situations because laws need to be passed to help America's progression. And sometimes the members in the Republicans party stop democrats from passing laws because they want the democrats to be ve viewed as being ineffective at their job."
"515",2059337599,"I believe either party will circumvent congress to push their critical agendas. The parties are so divided they will not agree with each other’s agendas even if it is a good thing for the US"
"516",2050044703,"Many have done it and sometimes the only way to get their agenda passed"
"517",2059434383,"I feel like the democratic party helps more middle / lower class as well as not rushing to deport immigrants. As a recipient of DACA and working my way to everything I have achieved, I feel that the democratic party helps more people like me especially since DACA was an executive order by a Democratic president."
"518",2046101147,"Because we dont even currently have a representative democracy in America...its ranked as like one of the lowest democracies lol. So the question doesnt make sense to begin with."
"519",2053532675,"some things need to get done"
"520",2054304349,"An EO is different in that the next President can reappeal instead of having to go through the legislative process to change laws. SCOTUS can review and strike down, ie Youngstown Steel. There is also the possibility of congress blocking the EO if they feel it is over reach."
"521",2054045279,"I believe if a Democratic candidate question the outcome of an election they have good reason."
"522",2054273693,"democrats tend to cheat and should have less chance."
"523",2052582479,"Just because"
"524",2054608971,"Because you, as the survey administrator, have a pure bias to Democrats. You infer in your questions that republicans are bad while totally ignoring what the biased left media, and you, view as permissible in their collective smears against ALL conservatives. Grow up and try to be unbiased in your questioning."
"525",2058403555,"Not ignore but try to find another solution"
"526",2055500339,"We don't live in a representative democracy - republican gerrymandering and the broken electoral college mean we will never have representation that actually reflects average American values. That's not even getting into the fact that corporations own our government anyway."
"527",2061620385,"Because Republicans are hypocrites, obstructionists and are supporting legislation that take basic human rights away from people. If there were to try to pass laws that took away rights of women to make decisions regarding their own bodies, or restricted the rights of black people to vote or gay people to be married, than they have proven themselves illegitimate representatives of our country's citizens."
"528",2056316461,"I"
"529",2052593737,"Depends on what be is trying to accomplish. If it is to protect or support our democracy, our under served and our public health, and the other party is just stone walling for the simple reason that they are the other party, then I believe it's justified"
"530",2052902569,"Because our politics recently are pretty much divided along party lines"
"531",2056009029,"Because the democrats cheat and lie, they are all crooks!!"
"532",2054045087,"n/a"
"533",2052746781,"Because Republicans never support a Democratic president. They make it very hard for him to get pass anything of importance. Mitch McConnell said that he would never cooperate with Barack Obama or Joe Biden before they even became president."
"534",2052835257,"Because the media should be impartial in reporting the news. It should not lean for or against Democrats just like they should not favor or not favor Republicans"
"535",2054788433,"Because Republicans are hell bent to wreck our Country. They stand for nothing for We the People. All they are about is power. No matter who they step on to get it. All this Republican Party wants is revenge for their Orange jesus."
"536",2052535251,"Because I think most media favor Democrats, and Republicans need to have equally favorable representation in the media."
"537",2058357525,"Error on this question"
"538",2054760637,"stalemate is worse"
"539",2052706995,"If their agenda will help most Americans executive orders are OK and have been by several Presidents"
"540",2059363147,"na"
"541",2052533809,"If the law is crucial to the well being or safety of the country and the republican party refuses to vote on it, then yes, the POTUS should issue the crucial executive order. Only under dire circumstances is my point."
"542",2052047641,"because they go over board"
"543",2053424893,"We need to do fair unbiased reporting and not target either party but let the community decide who they want to support. Reporting that is biased is definitely more app to fire up a community and you don’t know how they will react!"
"544",2059886269,"Because they constantly feed lies to the public, example Fox."
"545",2058281981,"Because the media coverage is not fair there are more liberal media's stations then there are republicans and this shows because all they do is attack republicans the coverage is not fair !"
"546",2056350663,"It is my belief that one party typically will be against anything the other party proposes. That is not a true representative governmet."
"547",2053629621,"Primarily because Republicans have a decades old policy of non-cooperation in governance when not in power. They simply won't engage in debate and block votes from happening. If a democratic policy reflects the will of the American people as a whole, I reluctantly agree to allow the executive order. The better solution is to end gerrymandering so that those elected actually reflect those they represent."
"548",2058337105,"Because they should be punished for there wrong doings towards the Democrats"
"549",2059568327,"It says no where in the constitution that we cant question the means in which votes were counted or whether only one person voted one time. By no means disregarding the laws that were passed by the state legislatures, but most on the ""mail in ballots"" were not passed by the state legislatures they should not count. I think the Republicans should have upheld the constitution, and stuck together to challenge the lawbreaking."
"550",2058011019,"Because the democrats agenda is Anti-God and Anti America First . all they care about is abortion, homosexuals and foreigners."
"551",2055545549,"Fox News and other conservative networks broadcast proven falsehoods they tout as ""truth"" in their propaganda war was against democracy and equality. The FCC needs to be empowered to require all broadcasters and media (including on-line news sites and social platforms) to be TRUTHFUL and ban (with severe financial sanctions and suspensions) false publications by entities purporting to purvey NEWS. This is a problem of conservatives, not the rest of us living in the real world. Right-wing, evangelical, white Christian nationalism has no place in our country."
"552",2052020967,"Executive Orders are a perfectly legal way for the President to accomplish his or her goals."
"553",2056075161,"We have spent the last several years with almost every major media falsely reporting news against former President Donald Trump. Even when the evidence was proven to be false, not one person in Congress or any major media outlet walked back their false narratives or offered their apologies. It has also now been proven that prior to the purchase of Twitter by Elon Musk, Republican candidate messages were suppressed as opposed to those of Democrats. It's now a matter of taking back our own. Stop suppressing news stories that don't favor the Democrats narrative, such as the Hunter Biden laptop story, (which has ramifications on national security). Our tax dollars pay a full-time Whitehouse team to divert attention from this matter! So it's not too difficult to imagine why a conservative would want the narrative flipped for a change. Even though it's constitutionally incorrect. The Democrats have been ignoring this for years!"
"554",2054788145,"Because it was clear to the US Citizens that illegal activities occurred in the 2022 elections and that in the prior 4 years, Democrats broke the constitution and stonewalled the functionality and progress of Democracy to the detriment of the country as a whole and often times illegally and got away with it. If both parties are operating as intended and ethically, I would not agree with bypassing."
"555",2044547005,"A president should only issue executive orders if the constitution allows it."
"556",2051666787,"The Media attacked Trump all the time and still continues! Trump needed to quit twitting and keep his mouth shut!! The economy was best under Trump and as soon as Biden took office, he stopped the pipeline and opened the border etc. He helps others with borrowed money!"
"557",2053696805,"Because right now with split politics nothing would get done. The President was elected to get things done. Both sides use executive orders when congress can't or won't act."
"558",2049986827,"I was thinking of current issues that are favored by most Americans but have been a top priority of the Republican Party. Such as Abortion , Same Sex marriage. I would hope that we are able to retain those rights as citizens"
"559",2053547215,"Because it is a known fact that republican have stated that their objective is to stop the president from passing any legislation. That is not fair for the American people"
"560",2058158305,"The government should censor the media source that spend time attacking Republican then democrats. And i notice before the election 2022 that a lot of democrats were showing bad video aganist the republicans canididates."
"561",2052533951,"There have been numerous examples of federal judges deliberately interfering with Democracy and not abiding by the laws and Constitution. Example... TX Supreme Court intervening in the 2022 midterms and stopping the count in Harris County when Beto was gaining more votes, claiming they had run out of paper ballots."
"562",2058309329,"Censor there negative, physical actions, you can't control what one says but should be rules, laws of what they do"
"563",2052022819,"Fox News should be bann"
"564",2058379371,"Since Barrack and Biden's presidency I can no longer recognize the democrat party. I am bias towards them because they own all of the big tech companies and trying to silence any person that disagrees with them. They started a division between races and no longer respect religion. I understand that my response doesn't match my feelings towards democracy."
"565",2049311257,"because it's a broken system and relief has to come from somewhere"
"566",2053504313,"Because nothing would be accomplished otherwise."
"567",2052742043,"Because I don’t trust ANY Democrat no matter who he or she is!"
"568",2053687441,"The judge forgets the law and lean towards Party"
"569",2051287413,"Sometimes Republicans will block a vote or prevent a 60 vote. R’s often refuse to allow something to pass out of loyalty to their party."
"570",2051822989,"No"
"571",2051823233,"because many judges appointed by publicans are corrupt and incompetent and ignore the constitution"
"572",2058334123,"That statement reminded me of executive actions which is legal so I have no problem with"
"573",2051985855,"The Dems are trying to kill. The United States. The Rebublicans must save our country"
"574",2058841049,"When push comes to shove, this is ok."
"575",2056299109,"Sorry I answer wrong"
"576",2053394573,"If one party is stopping anything from getting done just for spite, refusing to compromise and shutting down the system, executive orders are the only way to get things done."
"577",2053501755,"Because, in my experience, the Republican party is more concerned with either maintaining power or trying to get power. In order to achieve this objective, oftentimes they steadfastly refuse to find common ground with the other side."
"578",2058543825,"It seems as though when a democrate has a idea and republicans need to vote in it they all are against them so to be fair they should go forward"
"579",2052183605,"It’s obvious what Media Outlets are doing and Networks like MSNBC , CBS ,ABC and even PBS ,"
"580",2052742217,"Democrats are a much larger percentage of the population than they are of congress because our democracy is not representative enough. Therefore, they should attempt to get those things done which the majority of the population wants despite lack of cooperation from republican electeds (which there are a lot more of than there rightfully should be)."
"581",2056480631,"Because I'm a republican"
"582",2057367785,"Na"
"583",2054776949,"I honestly believe that its awesome and cool in every way possible and i love it so much"
"584",2057052289,"because certain things need to be done and the republicans do things just to play politics"
"585",2055948825,"If things are needed to be passed than over ride the repulicans to get the job done"
"586",2053073381,"because republicans care about the country,not just themselves"
"587",2053497349,"Because I still think there is fraud in every election."
"588",2051993191,"Because the media shouldn't get involved and censor things they don't personally know"
"589",2052870693,"the Media doesn't speak all the truths .... if yu are going 2 do a job ...DO IT RIGHT THE FIRST TIME"
"590",2058114435,"Because Republicans are just saying no to everything, regardless of it's good for the country or not."
"591",2059959277,"Republicans have locked us into doing nothing for a long time and they genuinely don’t seem interested in actually doing the work of government because they don’t actually have policy positions. If we always wait for them to do some work nothing would ever get done. I do think the President should use this sparingly though and only for the most existentially important legislation"
"592",2055370031,"Executive orders are a tool available to the President. A President from either party can use them to advance their agenda. Voters will judge them or their party in the next election."
"593",2057208123,"It depends on the law or legislation that need to be passed. I believe that the majority should get whatlawas they think are necessary in our country many things have been shut down by congress that would actually help alot of people butsometimes republicans may not agree for whatever reasons but if it would be good for the country amd the people im all for an executive order."
"594",2056311597,"At this point our government, with gerrymandering in favor of republicans and the electoral college isn’t representative. E.g., the majority of voters want abortion rights; the majority of voters voted for Hillary. Also, executive orders are a part of our representative democracy; these orders have limits"
"595",2051845097,"Republican lawmakers have a lengthy history of banning together to not pass democratic laws (as well as not meeting with supreme court nominees). Democratic lawmakers, in my opinion, have shown a greater ability to work with Republicans. Since Republicans are determined to block for the sake of blocking, Democratic lawmakers should circumvent this action in extreme cases."
"596",2054490251,"Democrats usually try to do good things for the general public. Republicans are selfish and try to only help priviledged people."
"597",2052691511,"Republicans are harming this country when they consistently obstruct the Democrats rather then compromising and solving problems. Society’s issues needs to be addressed. Democrats try to solve issues while Republicans scapegoat minorities and fear monger to gain power while failing repeatedly to acknowledge or address serious social issues like gun violence, climate change, etc. As long as the President in this scenario received the majority of the popular vote the president using their power as they promised the people when they ran for office doesn’t go against how a representative democracy should work."
"598",2056461303,"I misunderstood the question."
"599",2057933237,"Its because Republicans think that everything has to be their way or noway."
"600",2058264479,"Because Republicans make it hard for democrats to do anything to help lower class I think they should be able to make decisions without being cut down at ever decision maded"
"601",2054554973,"It's a perfect fit."
"602",2057090215,"Becsuse sometimes there wrong"
"603",2058302791,"The Demacrats and their followers lie about their intentions and have more media control to do just that. When it backfires on them (Democrats) they blame the Republicans."
"604",2060346995,"Three reasons: #1: I don't think we live in a genuine representative democracy right now. The Senate makes citizens' votes count unequally. I'm a freethinking person, and just because NJ's votes go a certain way doesn't mean I like it. Still, someone voting from Wyoming has more than triple the say I do on the Senate and the Presidency. We don't have ranked-choice voting, so we don't choose Representatives as much as we choose Lesser-Evils. Elections are often bought with TV ads, hit pieces, and greater resources. #2: I care more that we live in a democracy at all than a representative democracy. Direct democracy for the majority of decisions would be fine by me. #3: I think even in a democracy, some inalienable rights should be off the table. If a propagandist whips 52% of voters into saying free speech should be banned or peaceful protesters should be executed, there should be backstops against that- and Republicans often attack things that should be inalienable rights. (By the way, awesome follow-up question. I'd love to talk more about this)."
"605",2053172393,"It's just the way I feel. I'm 82 and I have never felt the repubs have really ever cared about the taxpaying citizen. It's their wealth they are more concerned about, what they can walk away with when they are either not re-elected or retire. To me they are ""repuglicans!"""
"606",2055709103,"Entrenched political interests in Congress compromise representative democracy"
"607",2054788491,"There is freedom of the press but it should be stopped if it attacking one political party"
"608",2059923909,"no one should attack anyone"
"609",2058472031,"Love Democrat"
"610",2054824205,"They shouldn't I was wrong"
"611",2055591339,"Because I believe that everyone should be loyal"
"612",2056461331,"I hit the wrong answer sorry"
"613",2055271501,"Because most media source's are liberal and are biased against my conservative veiews"
"614",2055794817,"Out of anger. I know it’s an iffy subject but the democrats did it rather frequently and those damn republicans always seem to play fair or at least as fair as you can get in politics.To me right now it seems like the democrats are the rambunctious spoiled children getting their own way and the republicans are the clueless parents that indulge them and when it comes to saying no they’re ignored. I hope that answer’s your question."
"615",2054120043,"What elts is so veary important that our elected presadent cant or wont take care of his own cuntry and the peple in it weather democrat or republican always hapins each side think they kno better i for one want a presadent to not only kno there job but also have the gumption to say to eater party this is enof and see the power behind exectutive orders and isue them and not be scerying behind other contries by saying only like most ofichals say thers to much work that needs to be done in order to have exeutive orders sighned in to law"
"616",2056243287,"I think that some of election results are just obvious that our system is rigged at certin times, just becuase I beleive in democracy dosent mean I should ignore obvious evidence."
"617",2050150323,"I understand freedom of speech but the last couple weeks all I’ve heard is Trump, Trump n more Trump. So much negative talk.I also don’t think government should get involved. After listening to the political stations all day most days. I just got tired of it n felt they should be talking about the issues n working on them!!"
"618",2057251303,"Because Republicans would do the same or worse"
"619",2053747995,"On issues where a clear majority of voters agree but their representatives do not act ( like access to abortion, sensible gun laws or countering climate change), the president can come closer to the views of the majority and issue executive orders"
"620",2055143309,"I feel they might have to circumvent"
"621",2051102707,"If the Republican President won the election with the vote of the people. Then it is his duty to circumvent a Democratic Congress to accomplish the goals of the people"
"622",2052204445,"I believe the truth should always be told to the public through the media. I am in the media and believe we have a duty to be nonjudgmental in how we present the stories leaving our beliefs out of the news. The facts and only the facts are what we are duty bound to present and let the public make their own decision on the truth of the story as they interpret it."
"623",2058705735,"discuss but not attack"
"624",2052086679,"Because the Democratic President is looking out for all the people not just his party"
"625",2054888263,"yes"
"626",2054227257,"It would be better if everyone would make the right call and not put so much emphasis on party."
"627",2057152801,"Democrats have proven that they cannot be worked with so most of the time they have to be circumvented in order to do the right thing."
"628",2052141403,"Because when you argue with a fool, you look like a fool."
"629",2056214157,"If the republican party won't cooperate or work for the benefit of the people, the sitting president should be able to envoke or get done, things using executive orders like dirtbag Trump did all the time"
"630",2060025537,"Idk"
"631",2057841199,"Mainly due to the fact that Republicans are over-represented in Congress based on the number of people they are there to represent. Gerrymandering in the House and 2 Senate seats per state have eroded the idea of a representative democracy."
"632",2051824769,"If it benefits the American people, and the Republicans want to stall or ignore it, yes, a president should go around them for the sake of the American public"
"633",2052533403,"The media has become very liberal and biased therefore someone should be able to balance his bias or yellow journalism"
"634",2054813023,"Because sometimes, I think the rules are wrong."
"635",2058259439,"I like Democrats and trust them only"
"636",2059209607,"I don't think their is anything wrong with questioning the outcome of elections If there is suspicions"
"637",2052669015,"There are some few conditions that cannot be ignored (climate change, for example). Using the power of the presidency to create the possibility of help should at least be tried to show whether or not the proposed solution would help. A positive example would help change some mins."
"638",2056403771,"Idk"
"639",2058309147,"Because republicans have to cheat to win."
"640",2053172107,"Because some Democrat judges are activist and don't follow the law."
"641",2059035847,"The president has the power to accomplish some things via executive order and with gridlock like it is sometimes its necessary. He understands the next president can undo what he did with a stroke of a pen. Legislative is always the best way to go."
"642",2058309247,"None"
"643",2055668763,"Because it's the only way we can save democracy. When the GOP gains control America will be dead. We have to use their own games against them."
"644",2053612447,"Both sides use executive orders and sometimes they are effective"
"645",2054406289,"Because its not really equal nor fair for media sources to attack either side."
"646",2058898747,"Because living in a democracy means listening to the majority of people"
"647",2058309097,"Because sometimes they do it for the party and no for own opinions"
"648",2060481525,"Because Republicans currently use those methods. Doing so is the only way to accomplish anything when Republicans are continuously working for their own interests and not working to do what the majority of voters actually want."
"649",2058259893,"The government should censor on social media because people like to share miss information"
"650",2055476037,"Because some media sources are corrupt"
"651",2052085859,"First I don't believe that a majority of elected officials on either side vote in the interests of their constituents, but more on personal agenda and outside influence. Second, I think either a Democrat or Republican president has the right to use executive orders to get an agenda passed if it is in line with their parts platform."
"652",2058425055,"it's super important"
"653",2056995775,"Because democratic elected officials are are liberal and biased. They don’t follow the law, their decisions are political."
"654",2053446645,"freedom of speech"
"655",2052138671,"Executive orders are temporary and far from an ideal solution. But sometimes the morality of the issue requires action that would be blocked by the fascists"
"656",2053285375,"very good"
"657",2058115913,"I do believe that people should live in a Democracy that represents them. But Democrats don't have the best intentions of anyone at heart, so in my opinion it would be okay in my opinion for a Republican president to act on his own to get things done."
"658",2053559633,"I think the government should censor media that is untrue or non verifiable no matter which party the media attacks."
"659",2053559951,"Executive orders are fully within the authority of the executive; they are not a violation of the Constitution or at odds with being a representative democracy because 1) they are reversible by the next president and 2) affect only the executive branch."
"660",2055623229,"Okay"
"661",2054439729,"yes like invasion of people doing their job. i do not believe that the country will never forget or forgive the racist and bigots of white america the hate. An other america have always new that evil and the revelation and satan. Black lives matter not the capital."
"662",2053975275,"I don't believe in censorship per se, but I believe in restoration of the Fairness Doctrine and some sort of regulation about whether you can use the word ""news"" in your name if over half of the coverage is of things that were made up or just opinions."
"663",2058118565,"No matter wether u are Democrat or republican the voting system and others in your party should stand by you esp if u feel an injustice was done. The voting system in this country has gone down hill and is not to be trusted"
"664",2055613559,"This country is bound by the Constitution, but Maga Republicans have dictated the law to work in the way they want it to. President Biden has passed legislation to work for the country as a whole, and the Republicans that have blocked or tried to block his efforts only did it for fear of a man who was not in the right frame of mind to do or command anything or anyone."
"665",2056051139,"The government should sensor either parties for attacking the other."
"666",2058315923,"If it is all in favor of the democrats"
"667",2057550139,"I think it should be equal for both sides"
"668",2053793601,"Because, no matter what party is in control, if members of Congress are doing nothing but obstruct and that doesn't represent the will of the people either. At least if the president is issuing executive orders it can open the door fo having actual dialogue about what is actually best."
"669",2055429991,"Government should be able to censor media sources that spend time with either party if in fact, the information they are trying to forward to the public is false! No one should have the right to spread false information against either side be it democratic or republican! The two sides of the story has gotten a bit out of hand between false conspiracies ie covid, stolen election & the January 6th INSURRECTION! It should be about what is good for the sake of our country & only that!"
"670",2059895345,"Because even issuing the EO, even if it is inevitably knocked down by the courts, sets congress up to push legislation through based on how popular the EO is. I think sometimes you have to push the boundaries a bit to nudge everyone else in the right direction; it's a purely political move."
"671",2052669235,"If they think something is wrong they need to speak up and the rest of the party should support then"
"672",2052742415,"The President was elected and has limited powers to issue Executive Orders."
"673",2061822189,"Because you to do something in order to help the Americans people when they are in need"
"674",2056440369,"Currently, political ads spend more time hating an individual and spreading lies instead of focusing on the platform. Limiting these messages and holding them to a higher standard on both sides can help."
"675",2052139141,"Because our current Supreme Court is very biased and represent a conservative President. Several of the members have had investigations into their past indiscretions, but they still proceed to stay on the Court."
"676",2058302841,"Executive orders are a part of the government we voted into law. If we didn't want our elected officials to have that power, we would do something about it."
"677",2058309863,"Republicans continually stop doing their jobs in Congress to prevent policy change that most Americans want. Since this continues to happen the Executive branch can exercise it’s power to enact executive orders. If Congress doesn’t agree they should work with the President instead of stalling everything."
"678",2057198947,"In the past few years I have notice that the republicans aren’t very cooperative and rarely agree with a democratic president so in some case I feel the president should do what he needs to."
"679",2054398411,"nice"
"680",2054177813,"Because both sides should be heard ..this is not a dictatorship!!"
"681",2050045121,"Because republicans don't represent their constituents, just their donors."
"682",2054693945,"Because Trump did it"
"683",2053501371,"Because the democratic president is trying to help everyone in the country whether a democrat or a republican and they are being blocked at every turn for reasons only that can be explained as to make him look bad and to pump up a base that doesn’t understand that these executive orders are in their best interests."
"684",2052106657,"I agree. If republicans can't show up and participate than democrats should be able to make a final decision."
"685",2054532187,"Presently the republican party is corrupt! Republicans just stood in the way of progress. When that happens and the other side has no solutions to the people problems then the president should use executive orders That has changed in the 2022 electron so hopefully we're back to representative government."
"686",2058390377,""
"687",2052930759,"I misspoke.Considerations should be put on both parties when considering bypassing Congress."
"688",2055193959,"Yeah I am feeling like I was just feeling good"
"689",2054090799,"The Republican Party recently has been consistently Anti-Empiricist , for most of the policies they want to implement, there's plenty of available evidence to show that either their assertions are outright false, or that there would be grave consequences if they were to be implemented. If the leaders of the Republican party deny reality itself, they should not be engaged with, they should be completely disregarded."
"690",2055697327,"Executive orders can be overturned by a subsequent administration. A President exercising this power in a corrupt or abusive way will, in theory, pay for it in the next midterm or general election."
"691",2054106549,"If it was the right thing to do to get the right thing accomplished and not stonewalling the American citizens due to some dumb egos"
"692",2061659555,"Because the question lacks nuance. Presidents have signed executive orders for several things that are not voted on by Congress - both Republican presidents and democratic points. I don't have a problem with a president - from either party - continuing to follow precedent. What I do have an issue with is a president (again from either party) deciding to sign an executive order for which there is non precedent or for a law that absolutely should be voted on by Congress"
"693",2055948315,"For a very simple reason. Free speech or no free speech, media should not be encouraged to broadcast disrespectful, and dishonest behaviors or attacks made from or by any party, be it a group of people or an individual. It is enough to represent oneself factually and honestly and to focus on what matters most, and it is another to cast intentional lies toward another with no basis of truth."
"694",2061069291,"Unfortunately, obstructionism is now the normal method of opposition from the party that does not control the majority of the executive or legislative branch. As seen in Obama's presidency and onwards, tactics like filibustering and hostage-taking can derail vast amounts of legislation. As such, until that behavior can be curtailed, thereby restoring legislative function, executive orders may have to be issued to pass important legislation."
"695",2051933389,"Because I think the last election was full of votes that should not have been counter and they all came from the Democrats. I want to see fre,e and fair elections.Every who votes need to show they are citizens and eligible to vote. And absentees. Voting that should be tied to a voters (maybe by use of barcodes and the voter should have to request one."
"696",2058309599,"I agree with it"
"697",2057197877,"Majority rules isn't really a difficult concept to understand."
"698",2055948887,"Because Republicans have already limited polling locations in many areas that support Democrats. We have to even this out some."
"699",2053004975,"The government should censor the media,because the media is a very powerful voice. They go after the Republicans more so than the Demcrats."
"700",2059666589,"Because if the president can get support from democrats members but not any Republicans, it means that they are blinded by their party and that is not how a government is supposed to work."
"701",2057377471,"good job"
"702",2058259539,"I have no clue"
"703",2056531079,"Cuz Democrats are completely evil and only are concerned about themselves, their family and money!"
"704",2052688139,"I think the government should represent me/us. But the government needs to censor biased journalism that habitually trashes republicans"
"705",2054788647,"no"
"706",2052938355,"none"
"707",2053156311,"They have great ideas"
"708",2058293261,"Because the other party no matter what even if it good for the voters won't help so the president has to do it"
"709",2061328139,"The democratic president is looking out for the welfare of the people and should be able to move forward with plans to better the country."
"710",2057112093,"I just know that republicans seem to want to make it harder for us and democrats are always trying to help so with that being said I don't trust a republican decision or judgement"
"711",2056367465,"In order for a representative government to work, we have to be able to trust that our vote counts and that the representative elected legitimately received the most votes. When there are doubts, the party should work together to prove or disprove the results. This is true whether it is the Republicans or Democrats."
"712",2052282937,"In order to preserve democracy, he has the right to rally for the people and work for it. Some Republicans cannot be trusted"
"713",2056849525,"I am free to vote and trust qualified people of my choice"
"714",2059078049,"When laws are trying to pass both parties should equally agree and when they can't the majority should have the right to pass that law and stop wasting time."
"715",2054250561,"I think that the government should be able to censor any media sources that attack either side. Media should always be non judgemental"
"716",2058309185,"For a law to get this far in Congress,then this law must be important. There for do what's necessary to get this law passed"
"717",2058170207,"Democracy always makes people feel free and express your thoughts"
"718",2052937743,"Ever since McConnell and Trump it has been harder for the parties to agree and work together for the good of the people"
"719",2053241501,"If executive orders improve quality of life, humanitarian efforts, or improves national security. Support the common good."
"720",2060968707,"Democratic candidate is working to make the world better place"
"721",2058307629,"Republicans will do anything to stay in power. They proved that already. In order to preserve democracy, it's necessary for Democrats to either learn to stick together or develop tactics to outfox the Republicans."
"722",2061679917,"in a democracy everyone should have the same rights and duties"
"723",2053702093,"I miss understood the question"
"724",2052234441,"our government is not representative in any meaningful way. the courts are a big part of that problem. the citizens united decision was the final nail in the coffin of representation of the people in the federal government - congress is for sale to the highest bidder, and will only become more and more corrupt until the whole system collapses. there is no hope. also, the supreme court gave ITSELF the power of judicial review in the Marbury vs. Madison decision, so in my opinion their power is not clearly stated in the constitution. their decisions should be considered as advisory ONLY."
"725",2061385705,"For the democratic people They are entitled to detour if executive orders to accomplish their priorities"
"726",2056838531,"Probably just because I'm a democrat"
"727",2061361081,"Republicans would. Republicans want to block all progress wanted by democrats. So an executive order may be necessary."
"728",2061792163,"If it's for the right reason that benifits the whole nation should get equal treatment. If Republicans want to block everything because they don't get their way then they need to be over writen."
"729",2052026369,"because the president whether he is republican or democrat was elected by the majority and needs to do what he can to honor the wishes of those who elected him"
"730",2053638297,"Because that’s what our current democratic president is doing"
"731",2056286201,"When the obstruction/failure to cooperate has no merit and is being done intentionally to sabatoge the success of the democratic parties term in office, by causing negative impacts on the economy, equality, civil rights, public health & safety or detrimental to the environment etc ."
"732",2056238131,"Regardless of a party everyone should be devoted in the truth and if there is question of a legality their loyalty and devotion should lead them to support the party in questioning to find the truth."
"733",2058302701,"They must rally for the people and for democracy"
"734",2056091409,"In order to protect the Democratic Party and work for the elections"
"735",2056845121,"They have to be ignored at times for the sake of democracy to work Some decisions are not helpful"
"736",2058342063,"Typically democrats want to put things in place to move society forward, to assist and provide, republicans tend to be against that."
"737",2056083753,"Because its important to accomplish their priorities"
"738",2055169999,"Republicans do not take the best decisions for us."
"739",2057733707,"I think it depends on the law the president wants to enact. If it’s in the best interest of the people, for their safety, or Health etc. then I would find no problem to circumvent congress if it’s an issue of true importance."
"740",2058683225,"I believe that democracy should be tried to reach no matter the consequences."
"741",2056205193,"I must have not understood the question well. I was agreeing that we need to have democracy! I feel like that new sources like Fox News is dangerous. Honestly, they are dangerous. They should be censoring some of the awful things they say and lies they spread."
"742",2060232153,"The legislative branch is not the only branch in control of the government. The executive branch oversees immigration, the EPA, etc. Executive orders such as DACA are well within the scope of executive powers. The President is also an elected official."
"743",2055690023,"Because Republicans would have done the same"
"744",2054017443,"The best example of this would be in 2008/12 when Obama was president, congress was under Republican control and it didn't matter how good or how needed to piece of legislation was to the American people McConnell and company would sit on it and do nothing. And in the first few years of Trump congress was controlled by Republicans the damage was immense because it was unchecked. Finally when Biden gets in and Democrats have control of congress legislation that the American people want and need is FINALLY being signed into law. If it is in the BEST interests of America and Americans then it should be done."
"745",2056367361,"American law might be violating human rights."
"746",2055731461,"Well I must have selected that answer in error."
"747",2053610697,"The current iteration of the Republican Party is one that supports racism, fascism, denying the rights of women and those in the LGBTQ community. When you have bat shit crazy people like Marjorie Taylor Green, Jim Jordan, Turd Cruz, Lauren Boebert, Matt ""but she's 18 I swear"" Gaetz, etc.. that are election deniers, ok with the January 6 storming of the capitol, they don't deserve to have a nominee on the ballot. Yes, I realize this isn't democratic, but they would feel the same way if the situation was reversed."
"748",2058260507,"Because Republicans will fight about it with the democrats just because they just don't like the democrats. Then the people suffer because they fight all the time. And nothing gets done."
"749",2057064815,"If is that important to the president he should make sure it gets passed"
"750",2053394775,"In this question, the word ""sometimes"" was important. I don't think this should be a routine practice. In some (not many) cases, ideological judges are clearly disregarding precedent and the actual provisions of the Constitution and ruling based on their own beliefs. In such cases, elected officials (who are more democratically representative than judges, who are usually not elected) should consider working around such rulings."
"751",2058544059,"I don't know"
"752",2053862795,"Executive orders are a legal process laid out in law and the constitution... I don't think the president should exceed his legal powers, but I do think he should use all the legal means at hand to carry out his policy."
"753",2058335091,"Good"
"754",2056688167,"They have okay points"
"755",2059363219,"Because polling stations are becoming a danger zone for Trump supporters who want to harm non Trump supporters"
"756",2055997355,"Republicans do not actually represent the interests of most Americans. Because of gerrymandering, voter suppression, and misinformation, republicans have an outsized impact on policy. For example, in the most recent midterm, 8 out of 9 Tennessee districts elected a republican. However, only 60% of voters voted for a republicans."
"757",2057300155,"The question because they do not trust it or believe with it"
"758",2058302361,"Have you seen any logic or greater good come out of ANY republican mouths? They literally just want to control the masses to support their agenda. We need to completely overhaul our entire society because of corruption and greed. Republicans are at the forefront of that. Our education system is a joke so stupid people vote republican which means too much stupid violence and not enough of everyone working together. Our governments have failed is and will continue to fail."
"759",2058647189,"They should stick together with there kind and rules"
"760",2056214175,"If it is legal and it’s a just law because the Republicans especially under Trump tended to have not just lies and really was oblivious to what he was doing I have a responsible Democratic leader has a very just a logical law that really should be passed because it is in the peoples best interest of the people of the United States then it would only make sense to get the law passed not based upon being a Democrat but based upon best for the people of the United States"
"761",2058403775,"Sometimes bipartisan legislation is not possible and the president should therefore use the powers available to him to enact policy supported by a majority of Americans."
"762",2056227745,"I think the Democrats represent more a democracy than the Republicans"
"763",2058268025,"......."
"764",2052021265,"na"
"765",2054526617,"In that specific example I think about our system of government. It gives the space for presidents to issue executive orders so I do not see the two things as completely in conflict. I'd prefer presidents try to go the legislative route first but if that is blocked and they can issue an executive order I think that is okay!"
"766",2056443547,"We're living in a partial democracy. The elected officials in the US aren't enacting the will of the people in their legislation. Particularly in the current US congress- a supermajority vote is needed to pass most bills & legislation, and it's extremely unlikely because of bitter political party divides and theatrics. Therefore, a higher official (like the president) should have some power to enact the will of the people through executive orders, which in and of themselves are very limited in scope as it is. This helps balance the power within the democracy."
"767",2053641091,"You got me there! I think the two-party system is too polarizing and often results in gridlock. If the only way to generate tangible change is executive order after struggling to receive the necessary support from Congress, then I'm in favor of presidents using that power. Having a representative democracy makes more sense in a multi-party system, which I believe the U.S. would benefit from."
"768",2059632875,"I suggested BOTH ways not just one sided. If people only use one news source they only hear one side. They should be discussed equally."
"769",2056367251,"The party has to be unified in order to get things accomplished ."
"770",2053656795,"Because Democrats are very petty and it was very clearly apparent under the Trump administration"
"771",2061820353,"Republicans have been against any and all law's that would hurt where their contributions come from. So instead of helping the people of their country the help those who pay them how to think."
"772",2053979345,"Republicans have consistently worked to undermine democratic processes."
"773",2058367983,"The first time you have to do a full face of hair and a full head is a good thing"
"774",2058360733,"Because in a representative Republic the number one representative is the president more people vote in the presidential election than any other election that occurs in the country. President Obama sign ed an exorbing amount of executive orders after the wave and 2014, and Congress should pass a law to allow Congress to block and executive order with a Veto proof majority or Sue"
"775",2054086419,"Because the media likes to be impartial. It must attack the wrong policies, whether they are Democrats or Republicans"
"776",2058402567,"Example Fox news they put out misleading information about democrats all the time that has lead to violence and an insurrection and attempted murder . Therefore even though we have freedom of speech stations like fox and others should be censored or removed to prevent more people from getting hurt."
"777",2053975473,"this important"
"778",2061492237,"In order to achieve the desired justice"
"779",2055612705,"Republicans are against basic human rights. (Women, LGBTQ and minority) They have committed to blocking anything the Dems are trying to pass. The Republican party has become so corrupt and incompetent they are dangerous to our democracy. I would have a different opinion if it were the Republican party of years passed but they are cowardly and corrupt and will destroy our democracy."
"780",2059603851,"They always sensor the Democratic ""attacks"" on Republicans. Why not sensor the attacks of Republicans on Democrats? I don't think its a fair playing ground when one party gets all the help. And while I have you here, I don't think the government should be censoring anyone or anything in any type of media, if it be books, movies, music, podcast, or anything. Let the people know."
"781",2055976139,"Because the media should take a neutral position from all sides"
"782",2056050585,"Jkon"
"783",2059443081,"Yes"
"784",2055940043,"Because democrats together hand in hand"
"785",2053683387,"I like democratic"
"786",2058015825,"Because Democrats matter, not just a Republican voice."
"787",2058262137,"Because in the last few elections the issues we've all witnessed puts up questions on if they are real or cheating"
"788",2053823669,"First the wording of ""attacking"" is what I thought of. I don't believe any media sources should be able to outright attack any person, organization, or political party. They should report and have factual information to back up those statements. When alluding to other media sources like social media where users often use freedom of speech but to post opinions that is understood. But slander and libel should not be tolerated. Saying you strongly disagree or even hate something/one is different than spread lies about it."
"789",2053306319,"I believe if there can be a fault in the election results,we should tackle the fault first rather than the allowing rules to delay issues and sometimes rules can hinder the results if not properly followed"
"790",2052533631,"Republicans have been increasingly vocal in promoting violence. The media has shown many untruths encouraging this"
"791",2056384641,"Good"
"792",2058302731,"I must of answers it wrong because Republican is more important to me. Democrats are always getting to break rules or bend them, just because they have the higher power."
"793",2056850803,"sometimes these executive orders are necessary to address an immediate issue or protect a class of people"
"794",2058302865,"Republican’s would do the same if the situation was reversed."
"795",2053246821,"not intersted of it"
"796",2058007383,"I feel this way only to the degree that if the policies are meant to improve the lives of the many (poor, working class, middle income) and are being blocked by the few (wealthy), it is necessary. For far to long rich politicians have put policies in place that line their pockets and the pockets of their wealthy friends. This will make it more likely that we all can win."
"797",2052512341,"Im a democraty party"
"798",2055841301,"To avoid any tragic accident may happen"
"799",2007435385,"Everyone has a right to their opinion. The candidate has a right to question and if in line with the rules and constitution, why shouldn't the other Democrats be more loyal?"
"800",2059572823,"It’s equal throughout"
"801",2054972679,"Just feel so"
"802",2053559887,"Because the goverment should be leaders in censoring all media"
"803",2055832833,"It's proper to keep the same energy"
"804",2056066911,"It is important because Republicans want to take OUR rights away. Turn on the news you will see republicans slowly trying to shift away from our democracy. It is important to keep them in check and if they try to change things in our country, actions need to be put in place."
"805",2053091947,"I think so"
"806",2057103103,"I consider I support the Democrat party the most, that is the main reason I would prefer to see those attack messages censored or banned."
"807",2055876913,"For legally elections"
"808",2053564619,"If the Republicans can do it, the Democrats should be able to as well. If we're 50/50 and have to agree that may be ok too."
"809",2058234241,"Democratic"
"810",2052706239,"We all understand that results can be easily manipulated by some corrupt leaders. Therefore if a democrat could have an evidence to his claims I see no reason why the party would lie low on the issue."
"811",2052691381,"like"
"812",2053156265,"sometimes the president should do the right"
"813",2059939743,"These media sources market lies to the public and unsuspecting citizens pick this up thereby plant destructive ideologies onto the mind's of citizens."
"814",2059977363,"they will not be used as liikely as in other places"
"815",2056281671,"Before a republican should question the outcome of an election it simply means he already he has a fully knowledge of how bias the results was."
"816",2054419055,"because most judges are Republican and are not fair and equal judge, they serve their party politics"
"817",2052846599,"none"
"818",2052883945,"like"
"819",2053435403,"Because Republicans against the war"
"820",2057443541,"I checked the answer"
"821",2055446869,"Attacking each other thru the media is uncalled for. Putting someone down doesn't make you any taller."
"822",2056227967,"Just seeing from the 2020 president where completely unqualified people were appointed to certain positions by a Republican president has lost its credibility of always being worth hearing out"
"823",2053862889,"Demor"
"824",2051653407,"To help the people, that the law would help."
"825",2054081277,"It is good"
"826",2054592911,"republican"
"827",2056354349,"There are occasions where judges will use partisan issues to play politics; there are already recent examples with SCOTUS regarding abortion or blocking releasing tax returns of DJT; then a lower federal court blocking student loan forgiveness and many more examples out there."
"828",2053858475,"I believe this because there has to be unism in the decision made otherwise an alternative route should be taken"
"829",2059746453,"It’s just politics. Sometimes you have to do things that a lot of people are going to be upset about, but there’s nothing you can do about it except change elected officials."
"830",2054687083,"If Republican members of Congress refuse to cooperate with a Democratic president for personal or political/Party reasons, I believe the Democratic president should bypass Congress and issue executive orders on their own."
"831",2060792631,"Because a truly representative democracy is not what we have in the USA. Our executive branch is elected on an archaic system that ignores the popular vote of the country and grants more value to votes in specific states. One arm of our legislative branch gives significantly more power to less populous states and the other arm is gerrymandered to the point of being wildly favoring one party or the other (depending on the state). In 5 of the last 6 Presidential elections the Democrats have won the popular vote. They clearly have the mandate of the people. If a Democratic president who was elected by the majority of the voters in the country can't get his agenda through an intentionally obstructionist Senate Republicans (who are have disproportionate power to the views of the people in the country), then he should be able to attempt to circumvent the obstructionists and let the (theoretically) balanced Supreme Court decide whether or not his Executive Order is constitutional or legal. That's why we have checks and balances. So get the fuck out of here with your stupid little wannabe ""gotcha"" question."
"832",2058900831,"When there is a question that there was cheating going on and I truly believe there was. Even in the election that we just had there was widespread cheating. The republicans should have stood behind the candidates in question until all doubt of cheating was addressed. The early voting and these electronic voting machines have to be done away with. Our elections are corrupt until they do it."
"833",2061821127,"In the past, the Republicans have been obstructionist to the point of absurdity. In some cases, decisions have to be made or new laws are necessary, and, when Congress is too obstructionist to pass anything, executive orders can be a tool of last resort. I don't necessarily agree with the framing of the question that representative democracy and executive orders are in conflict. The President is also elected based on the agenda he or she proposes, and executive orders are one tool that can be used to accomplish that agenda."
"834",2057666149,"It seems that these judges most recently appointed by a republican president are very interested in enforcing christo-fascist ideologies that are harmful to large groups of people in this nation. The judges are not appointed by the people, they are appointed by a singular person to push his own agenda."
"835",2063918559,"you posed the fact that Congress was not cooperating, the representation part of government is to form a group that does cooperate to achieve bargains that will ultimately benefit the common good. if one part of the government has decided to obstruct the defined process defined in the Constitution then it is the obligation of the functioning part to govern with what tools are available defined by law. an executive order rarely survives after the term of that President if they are so onerous. if executive orders are of such great concern to the legislature then enact new legislation to contain this ability. Isn't that what the legislature is for?"
"836",2061577459,"Media should be neutral; not try to influence by bias."
"837",2061999065,"Because decisions made by Democrat judges against a Republican action is usually made without merit and just a political move rather than decide on the merits of the action"
"838",2061904481,"Depends on the situation. Currently, Republicans seem to oppose anything proposed by Democrats. Under these circumstances, I believe the president should issue executive orders to try to achieve their goals, as long as they stay within the law."
"839",2063961017,"The media should be fair and accurate in reporting witch they are not."
"840",2064903143,"I think that if either the republicans or the dems are being attacked by the media, the media should be censored."
"841",2069654577,"Because with gerrymandering we do not currently live with a government that is truly representative of the people"
"842",2064696155,"The only reason I said that was because we need to reopen the pipeline and not let illegals come to the United States."
"843",2064633183,"If democratic lawmakers who support and believe in representative democracy are outmaneuvered by republicans who are actively subverting the law, there won’t be a democracy in which to support representation."
"844",2069268581,"Republicans have crossed the line into fascism. Everything related to politics needs to be reframed to accommodate that shift. They have proven repeatedly, they will resort to terrorism to make their point. There are no Gerald Ford's or Bob Dole's left. They will violently dismantle this country to stay in power. It is not a matter of simple political disagreements. They are shamelessly violent and corrupt. Our country is on the verge of becoming Syria, Hungary or even Russia, given how many openly support Putin. It is binary, democracy or fascism. Past rules and courtesies don't apply anymore. Can you even imagine a sane and civilized country allowing a Taylor-Greene or Boebert to influence legislation? We have fallen and can't get up."
"845",2064869167,"Life goes on, and the job of governance can't wait for a two or four election cycle. Ideally, both sides should negotiate until a compromise is reached. But if one side or the other just wants to obstruct out of spite, then decisions must be made or this country would grind to a halt. So yes, a representative democracy is important to me, and it is a goal worth striving for."
"846",2061712607,"The media should be neutral and report only factual, and real information. They should also allow equal time between the parties to report on, and not allow one party to dominate media sources unfairly."
"847",2061981169,"Notice that my response was only 60%.It depends on the will of the majority (note that eg 70% +/- of Americans are in favor of health care). It would be somewhat proper for the president to act ""on his own""?"
"848",2070585685,"People voted for a split government, but they still want to see the President accomplish what he promised."
"849",2061448529,"Republican would not want to work with the Democratic to do what would be best for the people."
"850",2070897931,"A representative democracy only works if both/all parties involved are working for the people of the United States and not just for their parties. The recent (last 20 years) actions of the Republican party are, to my view, more about party and elections, than representing the people who voted them into power. They have become roadblocks to legislation that is desired by most citizens regardless of party. The most obvious example are the attempts to pass even the mildest of gun restrictions even though a majority of Americans, regardless of party, would like to see universal background checks and restrictions on magazine size and assault weapons. In those case, if the option is available, the executive should act to protect the people. Another example, is the Dreamers. I think most people in the United States believe that Dreamers should be allowed a path to citizenship but the Republican party is blocking legislation. I also think that the filibuster needs to be eliminated to allow legislation to pass. Since the 1980's the Republicans have been saying that government is not the answer and they've been doing everything they can to make government not work -- the filibuster allows them to block popular legislation and make government not work. However, examples of privatization do not have good results either (charter schools and prisons), other than making some people very rich."
"851",2065107207,"Almost all of the general media has attacked President Donald J Trump for six years. You know it and I know it. Very small attack on Democrats. That attack was 24/7 for six years. Just to set the record straight. We are not a Democracy we are a Republic."
"852",2062187677,"Because it has become standard procedure for all presidents, both Republican and Democratic. Check out GWB‘s record for example, or Obama‘s…"
"853",2067211999,"That is not what I said I believe that the president should try to move the country forward let the court decide if it is legal"
"854",2062801385,"Congress is so divided with me having a negative opinion of the Republican Party as it appears they hold to party lines (more so than Dems do) vs doing what's right for the people that elected them."
"855",2061796509,"If the president has reason to believe that the will of the people is being ignored by Republicans or Republicans are refusing to discuss or vote for any new laws brought forth by the Democrats, I believe that the President should circumvent Congress and issue an executive order."
"856",2059417681,"Republicans don't want to govern just obstruct therefor un irder to oass bilks tk helo prople thusvus what must be done."
"857",2062312721,"Because today’s Republican Party has no interest in working for what is best for Americans. They are more interested in retaliation, misinformation, conspiracy theories, and opposing everything that the Democratic Party is trying to do to move forward and make progress for everyday Americans."
"858",2071019837,"In general, the higher ups in the republican party want to do everything they can to thwart what President Biden wants to do. I disagree with that. They don't seem to care if they are representing their constituents or not. I used to be a republican party member. I no longer am."
"859",2066096225,"After Trump's defeat in 2020, the Republican party abandoned OUR PRESIDENT because he was draining the DAMN SWAMP OR TRYING TO AND THEY WERE THREATENED. How can a nation with only 133 registered voters give 72 million to Trump and over 80 million to Biden, the math does not add up......WE HAVE ONE OF THE MOST CORRUPT GOVERNMENTS EVER RUNNING THIS NATION INTO THE GROUND."
"860",2064409799,"Because the Republican legislature may simply be blocking the legislation for purely political reasons and the issue at hand may be one that is of great importance to the safety and well-being of the country."
"861",2071978207,"The media bias is a danger to the country no matter who they target more. The media censorship is based on opinion and not fact."
"862",2069654667,"I guess I misunderstoode None party should be allowed more time attacking"
"863",2064236791,"I think it's a given. It has happened already in our current administration."
"864",2065744253,"republicans only care about themselves"
"865",2061755603,"The news media can't be trusted to tell the truth. They never attack Democrats, only Republicans. Congress should pass a law that the media must be honest. yeah right"
"866",2062205177,"I didn’t say the president should do anything illegal. There are times when it is within the president’s power to issue executive orders and if that is the case then he/she can carrying out the wishes of those people who elected them."
"867",2067794921,"Because they maybe very important laws like healhcare,social security and government spending. The Republicans already said that they are going to try and make sure that nothing gets passed,which is wrong. They are only looking out for the corporations that support them."
"868",2070684045,"Executive orders can be issued - and have been - by both Republican and Democratic presidents. They are an authorized part of the system; subject to certain limits. If the orders exceed what is permissible, they should not be issued - by any President. Also, unlike laws, EOs can be reversed by a succeeding President."
"869",2061971603,"Because both Obama and Biden are doing this exact same thing."
"870",2065357745,"Democrats have completely corrupted the election system, republicans lead before midnight and in the dark of night and early morning viola, democrats find 100's of 1000's of votes ,Need to follow the Florida model, have the election results the same day"
"871",2064105553,"I find the Republicans do not conduct themselves in a bipartisan nature when confronted with bills for the good of the people. Therefore on some occasions, a Democratic President should circumvent the obstructionist Republicans by using Executive Orders."
"872",2062919239,"when one party refuses to even negotiate with the president, it does not leave him a choice but to issue executive orders"
"873",2061487595,"crazy media followers"
"874",2069185753,"Republicans are racist."
"875",2070108595,"If it's a just and right cause (law). I don't care if u are a Republican or Democrat. It should be passed. Stan your ground"
"876",2062357935,"Because the Republican party many times go against Democrats just because it's a Democrats idea. They will be wrong but still stand together because they are the Republicans and want control, completely. They will take us back in time, with their decisions"
"877",2062282331,"Executive orders can be overturned by court and a future Republican administration. In addition some things need to be done. Such as addressing student loan debt and republicans won't do anything"
"878",2061328075,"Some of the media is out of control. This is the result of (Reagan?) cancelling the FCC regulation/requirment of Equal Time. NO media should be skewed either to Democrat or Republican."
"879",2063070945,"Because recently one party has continually not allowed votes on bills instead of debating them. I realize as I answer this question that I may be being hypocritical...I just feel that maybe it is time to take an action that will allow laws to be debated instead of dismissing them outright with no discussion."
"880",2063269641,"I think that I must have misread the question. I think it is important that both parties should be loyal to the constitution"
"881",2064724953,"I'm basing my answer on the present republican party which is out to abolish our democracy as we know it. They never will agree with anything introduced by a Democratic president, so the dem president will have no choice but to pass laws that will be good for all Americans"
"882",2067255719,"Media should not be biased for either side and report both sides of the issues. Any deviation from the truth is a lie. If I see the media slanting news in favor of one side. I cannot trust them to report truth in anything. A total lack of integrity."
"883",2062738733,"this republican party now refuses to do anything and there no partian help like there used to be, therefore to get any thing done, the president, of either party should step in to help it move forward"
"884",2065121081,"The republican party has made it clear they are for the party not the country The president has no choice put to do what's right for the country"
"885",2064377725,"Because it’s been shown ballot counting is flawed"
"886",2068881409,"Na"
"887",2069700253,"Both parties use this process….executive orders are easier to dissolve and both parties presidents can overrule their predecessor"
"888",2069715401,"misunderstood question"
"889",2069602759,"The Republicans try to stop the president all the time. I believe they sometimes are very wrong. Certain circumstances call for an overdose. Like the debt ceiling."
"890",2066891035,"It's been shown that Republican judges are extremely corrupt and have no qualms about making decisions that directly impact them personally. Any direct conflict of interest should be questioned and any decisions made under one should be completely ignored."
"891",2071277663,"I don’t think that and media that attacks republicans more than democrat should be allowed I’m sick and tired of vicious attacking in politics by elected officals and citizens"
"892",2061998277,"Because the Republican members of Congress are intentionally trying to screw Biden, the Democratic party and are not really voting on the issue,"
"893",2061869377,"With the history of Republicans sticking together as a block to prevent anything getting done, in the last 20 years, the democratic president has been left with little tecourse"
"894",2063793853,"Over 99 per cent of the time democrats do every thing to help all peoples in this country where as the republicans only care for the rich and they want only to destroy our country."
"895",2066044147,"The executive order is a temporary rule. If the Democrats can't get the votes it will be overturned the next election."
"896",2064557229,"Judges are not an elected branch of government. Democrat appointed Judges fail to follow the constitution and should be removed from the court"
"897",2051985273,"Because at this time its all one sided against Republicans. If it were equal against both parties then it would be fair."
"898",2063847803,"No comment"
"899",2065326775,"Don't trust the media. In alot of cases I believe they print what they are told to."
"900",2064377935,"Because the Republican Caucus in both the Senate and the House has done no governing of their of their own- they are the party of “no” stonewalling any legislation except tax cuts even if it is what their constituents want. If the courts uphold executive orders let them stay. I don’t know why so many peopl vote against their own interests and continue to support Republican corporatists but fuck ‘em."
"901",2064998829,"Because that is exactly what the democrates do. Doesn't make it right but thats how our govt thinks is the way it should operate. There should be term limits for our house and senate employees!!! Washington operates on its own set of values, which is in the toilet."
"902",2061908513,"The country is divided in such a manner that the chance of passing meaningful legislation is near impossible. Some issues can't be ignored, such as climate change. Having a representative democracy is an ideal it doesn't necessarily work."
"903",2064867933,"Executive order is a valid use of power."
"904",2065515055,"That is what we heard most of the time during this past election. Democrats were attacking Republicans all the time. Lying."
"905",2069539807,"if it is good for the people"
"906",2064938943,"Main stream media does not tell all the news, just what they want you to hear!!"
"907",2061574275,"Things need to get done, the government has to keep functioning. You can't have continuous deadlock. It is lawful under the Constitution to issue executive orders. Democrats do it too. If an executive order is unlawful, the Supreme Court will strike it down."
"908",2071234623,"I did not mean that election rules should be ignored, just that the support for the person that questions the outcome."
"909",2065898881,"Because Republicans and democratic presidents have been doing that for years and years I guess I'm just used to it"
"910",2065719305,"because that is about to happen with the House in Republican hands and the duty of the president is to lead when both houses can't or will not compromise."
"911",2067690323,"I think that EVERY representative should honor the oath they take and be loyal to the ideals of election rules and the constitution. They are representatives of our country and should strive to do what is best for their constituents. They should stand up for what is right, NOT what puts more $$ in their pockets."
"912",2061756187,"The presdent fas the right to issue executive orders"
"913",2061258839,"I’m old fashioned"
"914",2061539633,"Executive orders are a legal part of governing!"
"915",2065963905,"Because Democrats will follow their party blindly, without thought."
"916",2062988335,"I think both Rep and Dem Congress should be able to issue executive orders when necessary."
"917",2062358947,"i think that Republicans should respect the given rule of law of the outcome of the elections NOT the party. I must have not understood the question. equally I think that Democrats should respect the outcome of the election over party"
"918",2061625461,"Because the Democrats have bent the rules so far to the left that you need to be represent in force."
"919",2062187983,"Should only be used in extreme conditions. For example, the situation in Florida with Judge requested by Trump, who blatantly favored the requester over the Dept of Justice to a degree that made the investigation a farce. There is a situation now about a Supreme Court Justice blocking a Jan. 6th investigation in which he and his spouse on involved. He needs to recuse himself and if not, be removed from the bench pending investigation. This should also happen if there were Democrat appointed judges obstructing federal investigations. Until the last few years there was a great deal of respect for the Supreme Court, I would say that is no longer true."
"920",2069302915,"I think both came do job"
"921",2068912627,"Do what you have do"
"922",2069336789,"If it's part of the executive process I don't have a problem with it either way Republican or Democrat if it stays under the definition of a democracy"
"923",2069695507,"Because Republican justices and judges no longer care about the Constitution or the rule of law and use their positions to issue partisan rulings"
"924",2063548953,"not sure"
"925",2065551619,"Simply put nothing would ever get passed because Republicans would rather block the agenda no matter if it would help their constituents"
"926",2068822565,"To do everything on my own."
"927",2069268533,"Because Democrats love to cheat."
"928",2060347001,"When the court decision is clearly reprobate and morally bankrupt. The Democrat party is the seat of evil in our politics and has been for the last 3 decades now. It is not the Democrat party of my parents. Back then (first half of the 20th Century), Republicans and Democrats embraced the same morals. I'm not necessarily including the privileged elite in my previous statement. It used to be that ""liberal"" and ""conservative"" were defined by one's fiscal and foreign policy. NOT ANYMORE! Secularism IS NOT the remedy to this present problem."
"929",2067868591,"Because it would be political"
"930",2065909473,"Because many times republicans simply don’t want to pass legislation that helps majority of Americans for example universal healthcare, laws to address climate change, funding for renewable energy, immigration, regulating drug prices, etc."
"931",2064886303,"Online media sources seem to lean liberal/democratic such as twitter and facebook, they are also treated as legitimate news sources by the government even when they censor republican information. If the governnent insists on stepping in, either censor both sides or neither side."
"932",2064164751,"If you'd asked me 14 years ago, I'd have a different answer. But it's today so this is how I answered because the Republican agenda is obstruction. They block legislation from Democrats just because it's from the Democrats. The Republicans are mostly unwilling, with the exception of a few, to compromise on anything...something about owning the libs and weakness and blah blah blah. So, with that in mind, if a Democratic president didn't issue executive orders then nothing would get done. No progress would be made. People would get hurt from lack of action on the part of government. All that said, I don't think any president should go nuts with executive orders but the lopsided nature of the intent of the two political parties causes me to be lopsided in how I answer questions."
"933",2066038793,"The Republican Party has no interest in governing or doing what's right for the country. Their only goal is to oppose everything Dems do. This type of gridlock is intentional & destructive to the country. Everything must be done to over ride it."
"934",2067270055,"Look at the facts. The media bought into & propagated all unsubstantiated stories about Trump but practically refused to report anything about Hunter Biden or Joe Biden. Then take a look at how many democrats the news media have openly supported in the last fifty years compared to Republicans they have supported. Foreign interference with American Elections is minimal compared to accepted deliberate subtle inference by the highly biased news in American politics."
"935",2071974395,"Because that is how it works in the US. If the opposition wants to take it to court they can, however much can be done fiddling with regulations and rules by executive orders that fall under administrative purview. The egregiously unconstitutional executive orders should be taken to court and the administration stopped from abusing its power."
"936",2070859983,"Because that is the way the Republican way to stop a Democratic President is Democratic President, to help the people.is to use this method, when he can't get the votes from all party members"
"937",2068026751,"The Republicans always want their way like spoiled children instead of being fair and discuss the situation, ."
"938",2064672183,"because the republicans do not want to do anything for Americans"
"939",2067569441,"That’s not what I meant"
"940",2062871019,"If the opposite party refuses to work with the president just because of party affiliation, they should have a way to enact certain categories of policy without the opposite party support."
"941",2064696499,"There is to much indecisiveness between parties"
"942",2061211673,"sometimes for public safety you have to have an override ability"
"943",2056255273,"Because I don’t feel that the democratic party plays fair and that in order to get certain laws passed, this has to be done."
"944",2060628603,"Most presidents, whether Democrat or Republican issue executive orders on their own. Look at Joe Biden and what he has done."
"945",2062243837,"With some exceptions due to the electoral college, an elected president typically wins the majority/popular vote. A president who is elected into office by the popular vote has a mandate from the people to accomplish the promises of their platform. Attempts to completely sabotage or refusals on the part of the party not in power to reach compromise on new laws by politicians who often represent much smaller segments of the population is circumvention of the will of the majority of people who elected the president. Presidents have a duty to fulfill the promises they made during the election to the best of their ability. If the only way for a president to accomplish their platform is through executive orders, due to the lack of cooperation of other branches of government, then that should be the course of action they should take."
"946",2067269625,"I think that Democrat Congress don't like Republicans so they will vote against whatever just because a Republican wants it. They don't always think on their own."
"947",2066041197,"none"
"948",2064867867,"Everything should be fair"
"949",2065651719,"Because most of those attacks are lies, conspiracy theories"
"950",2067677637,"What ever it takes for the people"
"951",2064101211,"The Republican party is not picking good people recently. Before trump I had on occasion voted for a Republican. Now, no way"
"952",2070029177,"All the Republican Party do is obstruct everything that President Biden wants to do for the American people. Sometimes executive order is needed."
"953",2067765647,"In this day and age, judges tend to pretty much stick to their party. Some decisions made by them, by both parties, should be overruled especially when it involves American citizens or a person's career."
"954",2067816373,"If the democratic president is trying to pass a law to help the people and our country and to resolve the economy in a positive way yes they should go with issuing executive order."
"955",2063688257,"Media puts out so much misinformation that somebody should censor what every one of them has to say before it is aired."
"956",2064135105,"We have 3 co-equal branches of government, if any executive order is issued then if challenged the Supreme Court should decide the constitutionality of the executive order, then the decision must be followed."
"957",2060385919,"Executuve orders can be effective but can also be overturned by the courts or the legislature."
"958",2063984007,"Just to show their loyalty to the party, but not to circumvent the system"
"959",2069946875,"Executive orders are within the purview of the executive branch of government, assuming they are constitutional, then they are acceptable."
"960",2062159861,"there is celary problems wth the sysytem that need to be fixed"
"961",2069908339,"The Republican party works for the people, the democrats want control of every thing in your life and control your income"
"962",2071019999,"A recent president was hated by influential democratic members of congress and those members were refusing to work with him out of hatred and spite. In order to get anything accomplished, it was necessary for the resident to issue executive orders to move forward with his agenda; an agenda that the majority of Americans wanted. In this case, the representatives were not acting in the interests of their constituents; they were acting on their own emotions."
"963",2063762937,"Demonstrative behavior of Republicans suggests they are not serious about their positions, or take their oath seriously or legislate. What are the reasons for becoming an elected official? To help their constituents or to do nothing? To help only their donors? To slip language into a bill that hurts people but benefits the pharmaceutical industry? Or to undermine the will of the people? What happened with the George Floyd Policing Act?"
"964",2059569755,"None"
"965",2064630277,"Didn’t we just endure this scenario when we had a Republican President? He seemed to think it was okay to sign Executive Orders whenever he couldn’t accomplish his priorities. What is worse, a Congress that is so partisan that they do nothing or a President who issue’s Executive orders trying to bring something to table for the American people."
"966",2069747853,"It's because there maybe corruption or greed involved to easily influence the elections. I prefer an honest and fair election."
"967",2067374225,"My opinion is based on the fact that too many Republicans in Congress are opposing laws that would be both the working class majority and the country based strictly along party lines. Also, Republican President, Donald Trump, was issuing Executive Orders just to pardon Republican wrong doers so why shouldn't a Democratic President be given the same right."
"968",2063091037,"IT HAS HAPPENED BEFORE. REPUBLICANS STOPPED MOST OF THE DEMOCRATIC DECISIONS."
"969",2066150215,"Democrats are notoriously blocking imortant laws, even if they do agree in some form, because a Republican brought laws for a vote, and the president in office is a Republican. I feel that this is not done as much with Republicans. Republicans are more willilng to side with Democrats."
"970",2063984869,"Their are to many Trump loving, Q-anon republicans that are running their state a part of this country with lies and off the wall theory's and want to take peoples rights away that took decades to get making the country go backwards. Some republicans want to work with dems like it should be, But the Trump trains ones are want to believe in fake theory's and what will not help america."
"971",2064838375,"""Their"" priorities would be the priority of the majority of the people. It isn't illegal for Presidents to write Executive Orders"
"972",2071396699,"Because I do live in a representative democracy, I have seen personally, executive orders issued. I know why they were issued and the circumstances at the time. As our top elected official, POTUS should always be trusted with the POWER of executive orders! Sometimes, most times executive orders or issued THEY NEEDED TO BE! Congress needed to be overridden!"
"973",2062843419,"Republicans are not always voting for the views/wants of their voters, often side with a minority of extremes. They will also, put up road blocks to debate within the chambers, so that the moderates of their party can not vote for laws backed by the moderate republicans and the Democractic members. There are members of Republican party that have extreme views, including trying to impose Christian values/teachings into the laws, defying the separation of Church and State outlined in the Constitution of the USA."
"974",2061833897,"Both political party presidents issue presidential orders. It is usually standard practice for the president to do so when there is a gridlock in congress."
"975",2064237629,"Because that is only fair"
"976",2062039405,"Because nothing would get done for the better if one of the parties won't help the President"
"977",2069264993,"Because most of the stuff on media are lies"
"978",2067355029,"I also feel that the Democrats have and do the same exact thing. Yes it is very important to have a representative democracy, but we also need to over ride political agendas by the other parties. Currently we do not have a true representative democracy. Nor have we really ever to my recollection. SO whether or NOT it is important right now is irrelevant as it does not happen"
"979",2064164425,"Republican gerrymandering has made congress a body that is not representative."
"980",2068139809,"If the majority of Americans agree and support the law, and the Republicans in Congress just want to block any progress by a Democratic president, then i think it is very reasonable for a President to put people before politics."
"981",2068097093,"I believe that we should always obey the rules but you can still obey the rules and be loyal by vocalizing your support."
"982",2065100601,"well when Trump was president, the democrats wouldnt work with him"
"983",2062878931,"When opposition to Democratic priorities that are strongly in the public interest are blocked strictly as a means of retaliation action should be taken. However, there should be a strong reason for action (e.g. Immigration or abortion rights)."
"984",2068232993,"Because the double voting election rules like in Alaska is disgusting"
"985",2066042915,"It goes both ways. Censoring attacks that are unproven should not be allowed."
"986",2069560393,"It was clear, there was so much cheating and bs going on in the Presidential election there is no way Biden won the election. The Democrats just know how to play better and dirtier than the Republicans."
"987",2069057519,"It’s just makes more sense"
"988",2067832551,"They should always stick together .Unless they know their was no election fraud."
"989",2066761049,"Because most Republican policies don't help people. They want to stop Medicare, Social Security and anything that will help people."
"990",2062188225,"Because they use unfair tactics such as gerrymandering. Voter suppression."
"991",2071173929,"Na"
"992",2062879437,"Because it seems like they are attacking republicans all the time , and they are more agreeable to democrats."
"993",2070635875,"Porque sin democracia este país seria un caos total"
"994",2069527625,"Know I don't"
"995",2068503159,"You should be loyal to a point but if after recount done and lost. Accept it"
"996",2064592063,"i can't explain it"
"997",2063862777,"Republicans are not there to serve only to raise hell, lie and have hearings. If they weren’t so distructive and were willing to work across the aisle it would be different. They lie through their teeth with every breath they take. The President has a positive agenda and has to make accomplishments however necessary."
"998",2063669195,"It’s more nuanced than that. We now have unqualified Supreme Court justices - one in a seat stolen from Barrack Obama by McConnell refusing to bring a vote for a vacant seat to the floor (unconstitutional) A Supreme Court MAGA majority that are not typical Republicans, that are on track to undo voting rights, women’s rights, civil rights due to ideology rather than law. We are not in normal times to save our democracy. Not sure what else a President can do to save us from them. They do not represent 3/4 of the majority citizens."
"999",2062290393,"Some laws need passed. So a Democrat president may need occasionally do an executive order for the good of the country. Republicans tend to disagree with democrats even if the law works to help people. Republicans vote party and ignore what best for the country."
"1000",2063222109,"Because they should be loyal to the party - just as the Democrats stick together on all issues no matter if they are good or bad. Republicans need to do the same thing,"
"1001",2062644813,"I think some items are best untold and should not be public information."
"1002",2067905161,"The ability of people"
"1003",2065358775,"Democrats are socialist progressive"
"1004",2065575777,"It seems every major news source that is not censored already is very Republican based and it would simply be nice to have an Independant or Democratic viewpoint of it all that is not so biased. I know unbiased news is not something we will ever achieve but it is something I stand to be hopeful for. Personally, I don't believe the government should censor any news source, but I also don't think that the journalist should be censored by the publishers either."
"1005",2061833835,"make sure that the election is without corruption and fraud"
"1006",2057970657,"First, it depends on the issue. Republicans have been known to toe against the will of the people in order to circumvent democracy (ie: McConnell publicly stating that no bill will pass his desk while Obama was president). Second, Trump issued a lot of executive orders I order to circumvent the will of the people and further his agenda of lining his pockets. He also encouraged an insurrection - that is not representative of a democracy."
"1007",2064097081,"If they didn't nothing would get done"
"1008",2064896255,"Cooperation with the republican team would go along ways for goals to happen."
"1009",2061449231,"The media is knowned for sensor on Republicans, just like they have done on Hunter Bidens laptop, the main stream media is in withe the Democrats"
"1010",2061905605,"Because the Republicans don't seem to want to compromise"
"1011",2071301379,"Only in situations when is permitted by the constitution"
"1012",2063755887,"I believe that If a democratic president can issue executive orders it would mean that the constitution gave him the authority to do so.I would hope that what the president achieved with his executive order would benefit the American people."
"1013",2067872085,"I was wrong ,it was my mistake ,the government should be able to censor media sources the spend more time attacking Republicans than Democrats ,it is what I think ,I am sorry for my mistake"
"1014",2067868417,"Because the republicans cheat at every corner they can get away with, why shouldn’t the Dems do the same when faced with the same opportunity?"
"1015",2067359405,"Executive orders can be challenged in court in they go to far to there is a check on them. In recent years Republicans have tried to stop legislation that has had typical bi-partisan support in order to keep a Democratic president a win. But when they are in power it's a different story."
"1016",2065629667,"I don't believe we have a viable representative democracy. It is valuable to me as an idea. I think that Democrats have proven that they will do anything and say anything to stay in power and advance Democratic agenda items. I believe that there is such pushback against Republican leadership that a Republican president would have to issue executive orders to deal with an entrenched lack of cooperation from Democratic members of Congress."
"1017",2060466539,"I live in florida and do not agree or trust our state officials to have the welfare of ALL of Florida’s residents. I must admit, I wish I never left New England!"
"1018",2061396379,"When a president can't get Congress to compromise & pass bills beneficial to the American people, I feel he should issue executive orders as long as they do not exceed the powers given to him or her under the Constitution."
"1019",2064845743,"Yes, I can. In a situation like when Roe vs. Wade was pretty much reversed, the government should ignore this decision."
"1020",2069526061,"I did agree that living in a representative democracy is very important, but I didn't mean to agree to censor media sources that spend more time attacking Democrats than Republicans. That was an error on my part."
"1021",2071941961,"Because democrats will never pass anything that the republicans want"
"1022",2059171065,"Media and politics are 2 different things. The media covered up the Hunter Biden laptop story in order to influence a political election."
"1023",2069056279,"Because Republicans have to stand together to defeat cheating at the polls, and see that very ballot is counted accurately."
"1024",2065900855,"Is it illegal for a president to circumvent Congress and issue executive orders? Not many orders could produce the same accomplishment as legislating but perhaps an executive order could help the situation."
"1025",2064918761,"I don't wish to answer as I simply believe the election results have been fishy."
"1026",2064093937,"Judges who lied to Congress during their appointment process should be impeached. Judges who state they will uphold precedent and then hand down decisions that defy what they swore to get to be appointed should be impeached. Judges whose spouses or children are active in Insurrectionist activities and contravene normal democratic processes should be impeached."
"1027",2067711665,"republicans always have bad intentions vs democrats"
"1028",2062023315,"Two reasons. The executive order is temporary. The executive order will most likely be reversed at the earliest possible by the next administration of the opposite party. Politics has become hyperpolarized, and there is rarely cooperation across the aisle anymore. If there were more cooperation, then my answer on the executive order would change."
"1029",2063885405,"Sometimes, there is absolutely no cooperation to gthe president. And he/she is allowed a certain leway for executive orders!"
"1030",2062464189,"We've seen with the Supreme court that they will do things that do not represent the people and so democrats should go against in that case"
"1031",2070636311,"The press is supposed to be impartial and tell impartial truth about issues and goings on in Washington and elsewhere. They are not supposed to write half- truths and lies or give opinions as news."
"1032",2068834227,"Media outlets do not accurately cover fair and balanced news anymore. Media is largely supportive of extreme left politics. My way of thinking makes them part of the democratic party. Report the news and let us decide based of fair and balanced reporting"
"1033",2067755661,"I do not agree with attacking on either side. The question was just asked about attacking one more than the other. The problem is it is mainly one party that attacks the other party more. I’m for truth. Report truth and not just stir the pot to get your agenda out there. I don’t agree with attacking from either side. If you speak your side that is fine but don’t put false statements out there. All news is biased based on where their money comes from. If you tell me I lose my job or say something most are going to say what you want them to."
"1034",2061582077,"I answer this question this way because I believe that sometimes Republicans are incredibly self-serving and ignore issues that are very important to citizens of the United States. Sometimes it is important for Democratic president to push ahead things that others need even though the Republicans in office don’t need them."
"1035",2047368183,"Sometimes, people group together to support an issue, even if an issue is not supported by facts, in that case, a presidents executive order is in order."
"1036",2064319833,"Cause sometime democrats don't like the republican president and will not vote in favor of his orders"
"1037",2062023507,"Sometimes the judges get it wrong - something should be up to the people not judges - marijuana law - abortions - same sex marriage - marriage between mixed races - sometime judges are just old men out of touch with what people want"
"1038",2063748765,"The democraps always cheat so to hell with them. This is a fight against Evil democraps."
"1039",2067603183,"The rules should be the same for everyone regardless of political affiliation."
"1040",2067568289,"n/a"
"1041",2063875665,"Because we don't live in a representative democracy. We live in a partisan hell hole run by oligarchs."
"1042",2061933531,"because democrats cheat in every elections and are a bunch of fucking NAZIS"
"1043",2065775725,"I don’t believe that the media is good at reporting the news, ethnically. I also don’t agree that those “reporting” news should give their personal opinions and thoughts!"
"1044",2064812287,"I feel that the Republican party has become very radial since Donald Trump was President."
"1045",2065510175,"the democrats own all of the media outlets, including social media, it is about time the republicans stood up for themselves and started to fight back. There is so much Misinformation and vitriol being spewed from the democratic party and their news outlets it is sickening! The dems say it is the repubs who are violent..I beg to differ, that pig maxine waters, started all the hate by telling the people to attack the republicans at restaurants and gas stations, promoting rioting and NOTHING was ever said about that. She and the members of her party are disgusting hate spewing anti American communists."
"1046",2062125143,"I feel that the Democratic Party has gone so far left tha they’re destroying bthis country. They are socialists."
"1047",2062700951,"Because the media sources that attack Democrats most if not all 90% of what they report is incorrect."
"1048",2068027597,"Republicans have made it clear over the past several years (since Obama) that their goal is to obstruct no matter what. If that is the reason for the lack of cooperation, and there is no legitimate policy difference invoked or alternative recommendation, I believe that’s the last option to do the work of the people who elected that president."
"1049",2065784677,"A Democratic president is focused on helping Americans, not taking away their rights."
"1050",2068865163,"If the law that he is trying to pass is for the better of the American people and the republicans are blocking it just because they don't think it will help their lobbyists cronies or line their own pockets, then yes the president should override them."
"1051",2062417815,"It is because of the polarisation of the two main parties. The just and lawful activities of the Federal government should not be stymied by partisan politics."
"1052",2065707789,"Oh I miss tead the question totally"
"1053",2069656183,"To qualify, only if this is done when the order is considered essential to the overall good of the entire country, not just because the President has a whim to do something"
"1054",2064164937,"Cause there should be boundaries between the two dems and rep cause create less confussion"
"1055",2063136459,"Democrats would do the same.So what is good for one is good for the other."
"1056",2062187155,"Republican members can take things too far at times and people suffer."
"1057",2068307553,"Because the Democratic Party is untrustworthy, cheats, lies and does not have the best interest of our country and its people at heart. I trust the Republican party to do whatever is necessary to keep us safe and free."
"1058",2061655375,"Because Democrats want to destroy our ""representative democracy"" and replace it with socialism. The two systems are obviously incompatible."
"1059",2064351699,"In the current political climate, there appears to be a stalemate. If you had asked this question 10 years ago, I may have answered differently. The republican party is currently a cult of personality. They are more interested in power than in governing. The gerrymandered system assures representation that is skewed towards this minority in certain regions. We need an overhaul of the districts so that the representation in congress actually reflects the will of the people."
"1060",2067632549,"That would be the only way he will get those things done"
"1061",2066973587,"Well it shoes total unity in the party no always follow e!action rules though"
"1062",2067650247,"k"
"1063",2065588387,"Within the scope of executive orders. Cannot create new laws or break existing laws."
"1064",2061484093,"It turns into nothing getting accomplished…we saw this over and over again when President Trump was in Office…the Democrats did everything possible to block his policies…This So Called President does what ever he deems right…Look what sad state the economy is now..it’s disgusting…"
"1065",2065512549,"A lot of the time, Republican members of congress agree with the new law but won't vote for it because it would upset their constituents. That won't ever change. So executive orders are necessary."
"1066",2063014443,"It should be an independent decion solely alone"
"1067",2068094859,"I would not have made this statement without precedent or without evidence. Recently, we have seen the decisions of Republican appointed judges go against the good faith and wishes of the American people in order to push a more theocratic and dogmatic agenda. Democrats are currently -- and have for some years -- in the Tolerance Paradox. In their effort to stay centric, they give in more and more to a more extreme Republican Party. Until Republicans can meet in the TRUE middle, and not their version of it, I will be hypocritical and advocate for censure of Republican decisions."
"1068",2061530131,"I believe Republicans are intractable so other means are necessary. Also think inaction created by Republicans focusing on investigations rather than actions to help the people."
"1069",2072173633,"A single judge is one opinion on a matter where perhaps multiple judges or other bodies should decide."
"1070",2070146513,"Some media is very bias which make the people more violent so that why my decision is what it is"
"1071",2068882065,"Republicans threw the rule book out the window years ago. Democrats need to take the gloves off and fight back with any low blow available."
"1072",2068788891,"I have seen how a Democrat president has tried to pass laws to help everyone but was blocked. I want a president to be able to help all the people, that is why he is there. So sometimes a Democrat president has to do an executive order to help all the people or otherwise it won't get done."
"1073",2062811793,"Easily explained. It's simply political tradition in the USA. Dems do it and Republicans do it. It's simply part of the political fabric. If the voters don't like it, there's always the next election."
"1074",2066538937,"If the opposing party would purposely try to block anything, just because they could, the president was voted into office to be the voice in the country and if the only choice he has left is Excuetive Order. I don’t think it should be used very often."
"1075",2063129251,"Because Republicans are always trying to block what a Democratic president does, and most of the time the Democratic president represents the will of the people but Republican congresspeople represent the interests of their largest donors"
"1076",2067736413,"Well I live in reality and the reality is unless one party has complete control of the senate and the house, nothing will get done under that current President. It’s important to me that government works for all of us regardless of who’s in power but the reality is that it does not. If that’s the only way to push through an agenda that got you elected, it is an option. It’s not ideal to me though but the reality is much different as I said."
"1077",2067516651,"you asked me what democrats would say about government censoring , not what I think."
"1078",2064320163,"I am a proud Californian. I support Gavin Newsom and Joe Biden."
"1079",2067880107,"I hate Republicans"
"1080",2063700867,"I feel like the judge may be biased since they were appointed by republican"
"1081",2067394079,"Sometimes you may not agree with a person it is about supporting a party"
"1082",2068576069,"they should whats right regardless to what they think"
"1083",2065386353,"Social media should be held accountable for the lies it allows and for being bias"
"1084",2067521231,"Party loyalty"
"1085",2061948357,"I actually misread the question Democracy is very important to me I am a disabled VIETNAM POW veteran who has been crapped on by many Republican controlled Senate and White House's and if the Republicans have their way Social Security and Medicare will disappear"
"1086",2067792209,"Na"
"1087",2069898949,"I believe some laws should be passed without republican party agreeing especially if it comes for the well being of the American people."
"1088",2063156537,"Media should REPORT the news, NOT give their irrelevant OPINIONS."
"1089",2070127971,"because sometimes it is necessary to avoid them to be able to do the improvements needed"
"1090",2061946555,"I answered this way in regard to a democratic president not being able to not any concessions from over a long period of time. I do not think it should be done on one or two isolated incidents."
"1091",2071368283,"Ok"

"1130",2065170615,"Media sources (MSM and social media) have been colluding with the Democratic party all along, so there has been no criticism of the Dems. Social media sites, especially Youtube, Facebook and Twitter have been blocking conservative opinions since long before the 2020 election, thus influencing the election outcomes. MSM, especially MSN, CBS, ABC, NBC, and publications such as Rolling Stone, Mic, local, national and international newspapers and magazines have all pushed the Democratic agenda and silenced anything conservative. They all colluded to ensure that the Hunter Biden laptop was treated as misinformation. Just today, I read an article on MSN from CBS in which they finally admit that the information on Hunter's laptop IS geniune. The FBI, CIA, basically all of the alphabet agencies under DOJ has been politicized to destroy any chance of the Replulican party members ever being elected. Covid was funded by NIH and Fauci, who also predicted that Trump would have to deal with a major pandemic, under gain of function research. Trump put an end to gain of function research. Recently, from multiple sources, I have learned that a university in Boston, MA has actively been performing gain of function research, funded by NIH and Fauci and, guess what, the new Covid they have come up with has 100% mortality guaranteed! President Trump was first impeached for an offense that Biden actually perpetrated. Biden refused to give money to Ukraine, unless they fired the DA who was investigating Hunter Biden. Then when Hillary Clinton was under investigation for the tens of thousands of emails she sent illegally through her personal email account, she falsified information that lead to President Trump being impeached for a second time. Both of these impeachments should be overturned, because they were not legal in the first place. As for Jan 6th alleged insurrection, the only violence was perpetrated by Antifa and BLM. Trump did not incite violence. In fact, he wanted to send in the National Guard, but Pelosi refused it and Capitol police were videotaped allowing their players, aka Antifa members, into the building. They literally invited them into the building. The only person killed was an unarmed demonstrator, who was shot for no obvious reason, by a police officer. Floyd was not murdered by Chauvin. Chauvin was not even a police officer. His neighbors thought he was a real estate agent. Floyd would have died from a fentanyl overdose, and if he did not die from that, he would have died soon from major organ failures. The administration should never have criticized SCOTUS for overturning Roe v Wade. They just interpreted constitutional law. The administration should have supported the decision. Instead they used it to frighten the population into thinking that abortions would become illegal in the entire country. The governor of Maine, which has some of the most liberal abortion laws, used that to garner re-election, in spite of the fact that less than one percent of abortions performed in Maine are actually performed on residents of the State of Maine! As for the open borders, Biden stated that he wanted to allow up to 50 million illegals into the country during his tenure. Well, for all we kinow that target could have already been surpassed. Illegals are voting in elections, because most states allow them to have driver's licenses and in those states, upon renewal, the illegals are automatically registered to vote. We are paying over 100,000 per hotel room per year, to house these illegals. We are also giving them free health care, education, homes, cars, and more, while seniors are losing their homes to health bills and rising inflation. Allowing illegals into the country is in direct violation of federal US law, but that means nothing to this administration. If blacks are so oppressed, then why are so many millions of black from Africa, the Caribbean islands, the Middle East, Asia and south America entering the country illegally????? The only people who are oppressed in this country today are white Christians. I could go on, but......"

"1146",2067406491,"The Republican Party of today is more radical than ever. I wouldn’t have thought executive orders was the way forward 10 yrs ago but here we are. Republicans only wish to stand in the way of any progress and they are quite vocal about it. They don’t block Legislation because it’s bad, they do it out of spite. All they want is control and they are led by a cultist. So the republicans party today must be brought to its knees for Democracy to prevail."
"1147",2064825647,"Republicans have a proven track record of actions against Democrats, Democratic voters, and since about 2010, representative democracy itself. These include rejecting the 2020 presidential election results, accepting Russian support in the 2016 presidential election, passing laws designed to disfavor Democratic voters, manipulating processes to appoint politically-biased members of the judicial branch, committing violent acts against Democratic politicians and voters, and believing in conspiracy theories. I do not trust Republican politicians or Republican voters to keep the United States as a representative democracy."

"1157",2063727827,"Equal representation in media should be just that. It is one thing is one party or the other is actually harming the country, another entirely when pundits decide that they don't like one party or the other. Both parties should be equally represented without bias."

"1160",2061972651,"Sadly, because the Republicans will not compromise on anything, it is the only way to accomplish anything. This gridlock must stop.

"1164",1729705623,"I think there's a bit of room in this question. I understand sometimes executive orders are necessary, and it feels that Congress often fights against supporting the opposing party in lieu of doing what is right. In the hypothetical case that ""doing what is right"" for a majority of Americans would require an executive order, I support that. I would also feel that way with a Republican president and a Democratic Congress, though I likely disagree with what Republicans think is ""right"" for a majority of the American population."
"1165",2065780447,"In the past few decades, Democratic presidents have won the popular vote, and so the president is obligated to do whatever is within their power to deliver on campaign promises made to the people. The fact that Republicans hold the majority in the House, however, can be attributed somewhat to gerrymandering and so even though the House might lean Republican, it does not mean they represent the majority of the people. I'm not saying a president should do illegal things to push their agenda through; I'm saying they should use the tools they have to deliver for the people."
"1166",2067270209,"Because republicans will stop any law or bill that doesn't benefit them even if it's good for the majority of people"
"1167",2064576261,"Republican appointed judges (usually conservative Christians) don’t reflect the majority of the population. They are not representative candidates."
"1168",2069652341,"I said that both a Democratic or Republican president is able to do this. I do believe that there should be a mechanism that if the legislative branch cannot agree to something, the executive branch can create an executive action. But, there must be a vote up/down by Congress, rather than never introducing the bill at all."
"1169",2064070503,"Any president who cannot get past the toxic gridlock in DC to get ANYTHING at all done should have some leeway with executive decisions"

"1173",2064271521,"Executive Actions are by themselves limited. The President can’t raise taxes, circumvent government hiring policy, or make judiciary appointments without Congressional support."
"1174",2071403029,"Because the last two republicans presidents have lost the popular vote and packed the Supreme Court with radical judges. They use the judiciary to enact regressive laws and push their agenda rather than uphold laws."

"1176",2063208137,"We are so ""blocked"" by the Filibuster and lack of compromise because compromise is boring and doesn't get clicks or views on media.

"1177",2069654179,"In certain situations, where it is clear the opposition party (in this example, Republicans) is not functioning in good faith as members of a Representative Democracy, and it is well within the powers of the President to issue executive orders, it is an option that should be considered.

"1181",2064477991,"very"
"1182",2061622107,"Because I think that Republican policies are not supported by the majority of Americans. The way representation occurs gives conservative rural voters much more influence than progressive urban voters. Senate seats should be apportioned by population like House seats."

Republican President is trying to pass a new laws for the people then yes issue executive orders. Republicans seem to be the only Presidents that are willing to help us the people of USA. The Democrats are more about helping others Countries than Us the people of USA."

"1187",2062213363,"It would all depend on the law and why Republicans are refusing to cooperate. If the law is going to protect and benefit the majority of Americans then they should issue executive orders, especially when (as has happened in the past) Republicans are being uncooperative simply because it is a Democratic president"
"1188",2067598195,"The president is supposed to represent the people and repubs represent less people than democrats. The oppression of a minority by a majority is wrong & the oppression of the majority by a minority is worse."

(Power) If the President laid out an important plan such as securing and protecting Social Security for the future…of course the Republicans will block it. That’s a specific example why I answered the way I did regarding Executive Orders."
"1195",2065660329,"It wasn't just the Republican aspect, I could care less about offering the majority of that crowd any sort of protection from mainstream criticism, it's just that I feel any sort of heavy bias in a media source should be looked at with scrutiny, whether towards Republicans or Democrats or whoever. People are so content these days to hop on a bandwagon and generalize and spread hysteria about a certain group when in reality it's the farthest from the truth. Side doesn't matter, but this kind of behavior is alarming and needs to be stopped."

"1199",2062214565,"America is a representative democracy, but only barely. Practically all of our electoral institutions have certain functions or mechanical parts that give disproportionate power to the conservative party. For instance, the mere existence of the senate - the fact that Wyoming, with its fewer than 1 million people, is granted the same power in the senate as California, with its 40 million people, is abhorrently undemocratic. The president is not elected by popular vote, the house of representatives is grossly gerrymandered by the republican parties of many states, so on and so on. Until we get sweeping electoral reform, there is no contradiction in my statement."

However, we do not live in a true representative democracy. We live in a republic that utilizes a corrupt and broken electoral college rather than popular vote to elect our presidents. We live in a society where district lines are redrawn in favor of Republicans every few years. We live under the rule of a Congress that uses a corrupt filibuster to prevent Democrats specifically from accomplishing any of their goals, even when they hold both the House and the Senate. Because of the reality we live in, and because I trust Democrats do to what's right for our country and our world as opposed to Republicans who are selfish, stupid, deluded, power-hungry monsters, I support giving Democratic Presidents the power to accomplish their goals, even if the Republican members of Congress disapprove. Furthermore, Republicans no longer have goals or agendas for improving our country; they merely exist to protest everything proposed by their Democrat counterparts for the sake of disagreeing."
"1216",2064351713,"The current electoral rules mean that Congress is not fully representative. Smaller states that tend to be more conservative are over-represented in the Senate, and gerrymandering often distorts the preferences of voters in House elections. The executive order is a legitimate tool for Presidents of either party to use. If Congress is greatly opposed to the action, then they can pass a law that over-rides the executive order."
"1217",2066224341,"Because I do not live in a representative democracy. The US has always fallen short in this regard and has become toxic since the Gingrich era. There are more Democrats than there are Republicans in the US. However, thanks to gerrymandering, voter suppression, the electoral college, the Senate, a d Republican dirty tricks, the will of the majority is constantly circumvented. We have gone from minority rights as enshrined in the Constitution to minority rule."
"1218",2064869501,"Because many GOP officials ignored subpoenas during the Trump administration. You can't let one side do it and not the other."

It’s arguable whether the United States even is a truly representative democracy at this point. If the Independent State Legislature theory prevails at SCOTUS it certainly will not be.

It's based on office politics and agreeing just because the person is in your party, not based on the policy itself. Oftentimes, these policies then to benefit white, male, rich Americans. If republicans can get away with these actions, why can't Democrats do so as well?

"1386",2081521639,"An executive order, can be issued by a President regardless of his party preference, or who controls the house or senate. That idiot Trump did over 200 of them, and that moron controlled congress and couldn't get anything done, except raising my taxes to help out the rich fucks."
"1387",2082332983,"Going against the daily grind is dangerous these days."
"1388",2085956161,"The judges are sometimes biased against the other party, even if it's not the case"
"1389",2081459561,"There are times when you need to do what is right. As such, even though it is very important to live in a representative democracy, there may be times when this needs to be circumvented in order to accomplish what is right"
"1390",2082433485,"not sure"
"1391",2082569659,"I think the executive order tool is sometimes a necessary tool when another party is blocking simply because of a party line promise not to support and not based on facts. It gives a sitting president a voice over such blockage in some situations that can easily be reversed later if necessary. Executive orders are not permant law. This tool should be used very seldom and only after all other avenues have been exhausted."
"1392",2090070643,"this is one of the few ways to circumvent partisan obstructionism"
"1393",2082531599,"The question seemed a little narrow so I interpreted it for myself and included in my thought process that my answer would include that that order would have to pass the 'constitutionality test'. Also, this survey is starting to look a little on the biased side. I would have answered the same for a Democrat president, as far as executive orders are concerned. What is good for the goose is good for the gander."
"1394",2082467069,"At the moment, the problem is that most of the press has been bought and paid for by the Democrats and instead of being censored, they should have their licenses yanked. They would be screaming about what’s happening to them even though they are doing the same things to the Republicans."
"1395",2084181133,"There are times when you have to do something to move forward. Now days there is so much hate the government gets nothing done. I'm not saying an executive order should be done all the time but use common sense before issuing an excutive order."
"1396",2082706605,"Executive orders and representative democracy can coexist"
"1397",2081412535,"I think the less poll places we have the better control we can have on who is voting there and how much safer the voter would be."
"1398",2083175373,"they think they can do what they want"
"1399",2084709389,"It depends on the law(s) are for. If it benefits all Americans, the Democratic president should circumvent Congress. As an example, President Biden used his authority to make the railroad workers work from going on strike. Because, it would keep the government moving forward."
"1400",2090065619,"When a congressional majority has made it their publically stated goal to reject and deny any and all efforts by a president (such as happened with Obama), the president must use the means he has at hand to get SOME things done. It is my honest belief that unfortunately now the republicans are slipping into an authoritarian mindset whereas the dems are still trying to accomplish getting progressive improvements made to ordinary people's lives. these two differing philosophies are not compatible with success."
"1401",2082269773,"I think the Republicans are deliberately blocking the Democratic president not out of concern for doing what is best for citizens but to win. By that I mean politics has become a team sport and ""winning"" is the goal. Not doing what is best for the citizens of the US. There is little if any cooperation and no compromising with the other side. Both the Democrats and the Republicans are guilty of this approach. However, the Republicans seem to engage more in this behavior."
"1402",2080432441,"my mistake, should have been unimportant"
"1403",2080410363,"It works the same for a Republician president. There are certain areas in which a President can legally issue an executive orders"
"1404",2082211037,"Not enough space....."
"1405",2088805161,"With some of the deadlock that is occuring in our government, the President, whether Democrat or Republican, may have no other option to get important legislative enacted. With the current Filibuster rules in play, I believe that there is a place for executive orders. I do not think they should be used without careful consideration."
"1406",2081323185,"Because it is TRUE!"
"1407",2081750649,"If there is a margin of votes and a person is claimed a winner then at the last minute is stated they aren’t there should be a recount and the same party should stand behind the person to proven not elected to many Rhino REPUBLICANS"
"1408",2089863907,"If it is important to the people of the USA and needs to be a new law then do it. Sometimes Congress doesn't bother to listen or have common sense."
"1409",2081323115,"Partisanship"
"1410",2082801571,"Should be equal"
"1411",2082767965,"If there is evidence of corruption in an election it should be examined and final decision made based on the evidence. In the past two elections there has been overwhelming evidence of corruption yet not one single judge, including the Supreme Court, has had the backbone to examine it and make a quality decision. That is what grates against the grain. Money and power has taken precidence over a true and fair election."
"1412",2083054281,"When a republican questions a election result its for valid reasons. Your question is wrong and backwards questioning corruption and stealing is constitutional rule of law. Fir example Arizona is full of election corruption and fraud and constitutional rule of law tells us that needs to be looked into and those involved to be prosecuted fully and maybe while new election redone. Kari Lake probly won and on 2020 president Trump won. It's obvious. To turn a blind to corruption as your would want is evil"
"1413",2081416565,"When put in that context you make a strong point, and I guess I would have to say that I am just so frustrated and disheartened by what seems to be the complete unfairness and lack of ethics that seem to embody the 'new' Republicans (including Kari Lake, MTG, Boebert (sp?), etc., however two wrongs do not make a right, but, again, solutions to climate change, gun control, and so many other issues seem to be blatantly denied and roadblocked by the Republicans, and on a final, albeit trivial note, as a moderate and ex NY'r living in purple WI., it is so disheartening to pay at the pump when gas was so high due to the Ukraine war and see stickers on the pump of Biden pointing to the price saying ""I did this"". May be a bit off point, but welcome to the new right wing political climate."
"1414",2081453501,"The attack of one party by the other needs to stop. It doesn't matter if it's Democrat attacking Republican or Republican attacking Democrat. It just needs to stop."
"1415",2088446087,"The system we live today, some politicians are more connected with their interests than others, therefore presidents may need to do this if it benefits everybody, for example, gun laws"
"1416",2090065245,"democrats cheat, always."
"1417",2087959663,"because media censored the biden lap top prior to the election"
"1418",2088407875,"better democracy"
"1419",2082239223,"Ok"
"1420",2082631855,"Only if election rules were not followed."
"1421",2082498331,"If the people are in favor of the policy yes Otherwise no"
"1422",2081609293,"At least the Democrat's are trying to pass new laws..."
"1423",2082770225,"There should be equal party representation but the fact is that based on my present knowledge the Republican party is in most control of the media."
"1424",2082769361,"Executive Orders are legal. Radical right wing obstructionist actions in Congress are unacceptable."
"1425",2082383431,"Some things are neccessary to move our government forward. I believe that politics usually prevents action"
"1426",2081511435,"Support representative democracy, but both parties should do the same. Unfortunately, the hypocrisy of the Republican Party mandates that Democrats must play by the same rules, thus undermining representative democracy but pragmatically necessary"
"1427",2088535965,"Based on current make up of us reps and senators in our current congress with 50-50 senators fighting each other when bills are introduce in the senate for voting ."
"1428",2082435189,"executive orders only last through the presidents term, the next president can do away with them. lately the republicans aren't even trying to govern to work with anyone but extremists"
"1429",2082316773,"I dont think either party should be attacking each other. We should be fair to each other"
"1430",2083111079,"Same result ss Democrats have been doing"
"1431",2087049619,"If the President cannot get the opposing party to cooperate. Then he has the right to issue an Executive Order to help promote his policies."
"1432",2087843533,"they should be fair to both parties"
"1433",2082114919,"I think there should always be a check and balance and if you don’t have it then things get out of hand even though people are trying to be loyal other people are trying to rob the system"
"1434",2081314687,"I think this would end the claims of voter fraud"
"1435",2082172935,"Because at this point in time the Republican party has too many actions and views that are detrimental to the American form of Goverment. Thank you."
"1436",2084217741,"Because of their Democrat they said always be a Democrat Republicans do it all the time but they lie about it"
"1437",2081415065,"It's not the best thing to do, but sometimes it's all that can be done. I have witnessed Republican obstruction for many years; they will obstruct even when the majority of Americans WANT those bills passed. They vowed to obstruct anything Obama supported and they did. Should Republicans be allowed to gridlock and block things that Americans want? I don't think so. Very few of them will work in a bipartisan manner. And they have gerrymandered their way into winning seats even though they are in the minority."
"1438",2084478517,"I don't know"
"1439",2081958057,"I believe the President has the power to issue executive orders, no matter what party they are. Both Democrat and Republican presidents have issued executive orders that the other party didn't approve. It's within the Presidents rights. Therefore it's still living in a representative democracy. Because that law and power was decided by the people."
"1440",2083021793,"idk"
"1441",2085755927,"Obama started this crap with his famous, “I have a pen and a phone” to circumvent Congress. What good for the goose is good for the gander."
"1442",2081281731,"Because democrats have proven now that they will do anything against republicans, which I believe is being corrupt in voting…stealing election votes. The majority of democrats are totally one-sided and corrupt. I never felt this way before The Biden presidency and the democrats started doing everything they could, legally or not, against anything republicans try to accomplish, ie border control. I believe we cannot believe in the democrats to do things legally and for the USA benefit."
"1443",2089631819,"Because I know that is exactly what a Democrat would do!!!"
"1444",2088625913,"Because sometimes the media causes discord and divisiveness within the country."
"1445",2083231529,". I think that we should all respect what the every individual has a right to express their opinion it's called freedom of speech."
"1446",2089668367,"we have to stick together..the Dems are killing America and cheating on elections"
"1447",2090065451,"Because in a democratic society it should be fair and square for both the parties"
"1448",2077063703,"It depends on what the law is. If the law is clearly supported by a majority of Americans and the influence of special interests and big money prevent congress from passing the law then the truly democratic thig to do would be for the president to issue an executive order. I believe to be the case no matter what party the president belongs to,"
"1449",2085889185,"The president should only use executive orders when they have the authority to do so, including when Republican politicians block legislative action. Often, executive orders are more in line with the will of the majority of Americans. Republicans often block legislation that has majority support in the United States. Thus, an executive order can serve to be representative of the will of the people."
"1450",2080874859,"I think the party of both should back each other"
"1451",2082209179,"Well Donald trump did it and destroyed our country so if it's to help Biden pass more progressive policies that are going to help the hard working poor people in this country and better our economy and our lives our planet our democracy . Biden should use his executive privilege to pass policies that'll make corporate donations illegal and start cutting corruption by getting the greed caused my money outta our political judicial and justice systems and make having housing education health insurance childcare and being paid a livable wage as a human right that has to be upheld."
"1452",2082769227,"The question stated cooperation, not necessarily approval. Both parties have a duty to cooperate and if one is stonewalling based on political representation and jeopardizing progress, the president should do what he/she has to for the betterment of the country."
"1453",2082151695,"Because in reality republicans are completely unwilling to compromise so what other options do you have to fix immediate problems. It’s not ideal but with the current state of the Republican Party it is necessary"
"1454",2081415277,"Because sometimes partisan politics can block good ideas. This goes for both parties."
"1455",2087618017,"T%he former president was back by republicans to pass things over the objection of the people and the democrats. Example Supreme Court judges who were put in faster then they would allow a democrat president appointee"
"1456",2083144513,"Because Joe Biden has done and continues to do it. Biden even goes against rulings from the Supreme Court. If the Democrats can do what ever they want then Republican should be able to do the same."
"1457",2082112685,"Given that the most recent midterm election had ""issues"" that swayed some people from voting because of lines and the request to keep polls open longer was rejected I dont believe the election laws were followed"
"1458",2082851963,"If it is legal, and constitutionally defensible, any president should have the right and power to use executive orders."
"1459",2081548149,"Because if the Democrat appointed judge did not follow the Constitution, it is permissible for the Republican official to do what is right and let the matter be decided by a higher court."
"1460",2088071163,"Because the things that The Republicans have been doing the last few years need to be fixed."
"1461",2077401537,"Sometimes something has to give a little in order to get things accomplished for the good of our country."
"1462",2088176519,"I think with executive orders it's the only way to move forward and pass laws when there is no agreement and support from Republicans in Congress when there is a Democratic president"
"1463",2082191259,"The republicans have openly admitted that they don’t care what the goals are of the democrats, only that they want to stop any “agenda” they have. They’re disruptive to progress on purpose."
"1464",2081347355,"Government should intervene when the media attacks one party usually Republicans and intentionally distort the truth or not report the truth. Look at the Emails released by Musk as Twitter right before the 2020 Election Day on laptop story. Jack Dorsey admits to it! One example of many"
"1465",2079916487,"I think that our two-party system isn't exactly an effective representative democracy, as it over-simplifies people's wants and needs into two categories in a way that is even a bit nonsensical. For example, I have to support democrats in general no matter what because republican social policies tend to be hostile to my existence and basic human rights, so I don't have lee-way to pay much attention to other policies. I think our democracy is better than the alternatives, but I think it's still deeply flawed and we lose a lot of progress and government effectiveness to petty and weirdly divided partisan politics that feels more like watching sports teams compete than trusting politicians with representing us. I am conflicted about this though, as I think the president's power, and all power, should be kept in check."
"1466",2089444055,"A representative means we have to right to question an election where there is a potential for voter fraud or any other issues that effect the election results. I don't what party it is that questions elections if there is any real evidence than we all should be concerned. Ask Ozzy Myers about election laws and the constitution. He committed voter fraud in 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018. So living in a representative democracy means the votes get to choose not Myers or anyone like him regardless of the political party or media or big tech."
"1467",2088755891,"Because Democrats have changed the economic structure of this country for the worst so we need a stronger Republican presence."
"1468",2082231137,"Nowadays, their image is tainted by lies which is also why they lose elections more than democrats. What is that if not oppression?"
"1469",2090067925,"I thought about this when answering. I actually believe media sources should be shut down if they can't fairly and accurately report the facts. The media has incited more violence and hatred in this Country than any other group. This is not Democracy, it's everything America is not. The media pushes their own agenda and it leans towards Socialism and Communism."
"1470",2088819743,"Because Republicans and Democrats need to be fair"
"1471",2080410397,"I think I was confused answering those questions"
"1472",2083022091,"Unlike the Democrats Republicans will not stick together, Some of them are Democrats in Republican clothing such as Lisa McCaskey Mitt Romney...Yet Republicans have a weak leader in Mitch McConnell"
"1473",2085839349,"Since Donald Trump arrived on the scene, there is no bipartisian among congress. There is Democrats, Trumpsters, and Repubs. Repubs have common sence, Trumpsters are brainwashed. We as a country cannot live with people in congress that only do what their leader tells them. There is no democracy in America any more. People deny judges orders, do not show up in court, and congress has allowed this in the last few years, since Big Red showed up at the white house after loosing the election by millions of votes."
"1474",2082801051,"because democrats are criminals"
"1475",2077974805,"I don't believe in censorship but Democrats and liberal media censor conservative voices and Nothing is ever done about it."
"1476",2081692267,"Because we would have four years of getting nothing accomplished. The President does have a right to issue executive decisions. In an ideal world ,if Congress would follow the best thing for the country and not themselves, maybe the President woul not have to resort to executive orders."
"1477",2083229137,"Because they are right now"
"1478",2083224563,"Feeling the stress of the pending GOP house, is the reason for my statement. Government is so belligerent right now...since trump!!"
"1479",2087957959,"Don't know"
"1480",2083109891,"because the republican speaker made known that he would oppose everything president biden brought forward that aint right"
"1481",2088031221,"I made an error....they should both be censored"
"1482",2090065243,"The rules are important"
"1483",2082800343,"I do not trust the voting system in the United States anymore. The Democrats cheated the last presidential election. I do not trust any election results that the democrats have control over. The Republicans must talk up more to prevent the cheating. Now we have an imbecile for president, a sick man that others are controlling, due to cheating election results."
"1484",2082605933,"Because Politicians and political parties will use any mean likely to get their way . Both parties"
"1485",2088454947,"There is a lot of election fraud, some results are very suspicious."
"1486",2086995603,"I believe in a representative democracy, but I also believe in exceptions."
"1487",2082215451,"Why because the of the Dummocrats track record of False Impeachments twice and always Sendi g and using the FBI and DOJ as there Personal Police!! 👇👎🖕"
"1488",2083724349,"Representative in congress so should find common ground to reach a consensus to pass policies for the good of the people. That's why they can add aammendments and limits to policies.But if they just bring obstacles then it's OK to circumvent the process."
"1489",2089806611,"it would apply also if media sources were attacking Republicans more than Democrats, media should be biased"
"1490",2088604721,"Democrats"
"1491",2079194375,"Otherwise nothing would get done during the presidents term"
"1492",2089262843,"Firstly, we don't really live in a representative democracy. We live in an oligarchy where bought elections, first-past-the-post voting, and unelected officials pollute our decision-making. If capitalists in congress (almost the entire Republican party and still most of the Democrats) are against majority positions like ending wars, drug reform, and universal healthcare, a good president would issue an executive order. If it's about representative democracy, the issue should just be decided by a direct ballot measure with grassroots-only rules for ad spending."
"1493",2082467723,"It depends on the issue. I think there are certain social issues where a Democratic president should be able to circumvent Congress, such as equal rights for gays, access to abortion, issues where clearly the majority of Americans support the issue."
"1494",2083253851,"Media presented by the Republican Party is often fueled by false propaganda and spread’s misinformation among American citizens thus fueling tensions in the country itself."
"1495",2090065659,"because republican officials should only work with republican judges."
"1496",2088757401,"There's alot of fraud going on"
"1497",2078779363,"You're making it sound like Republicans are untrustworthy. I think all congress should follow the law. The constitution. Corruption at its worst are both parties. Do what's right"
"1498",2079504711,"It is very important to me to live in a representative democracy, but given the state of gerrymandering, we do not currently live in one."
"1499",2082672337,"If those judges were appointed by Republican presidents that were not elected by popular vote, ignoring court decisions made by the judges is still abiding by the rules of representative democracy."
"1500",2081231637,"The decisions made by republican president-appointed judges could be biased or deliberately hindering executive processes."
"1501",2082270641,"Because I believe that the Federalist Society has infiltrated our judicial system. Mitch McConnell refused to seat (or even hold hearings on!!) hundreds of Obama’s nominees. That makes the judiciary fundamentally an unrepresentative branch of our government."
"1502",2088223811,"The Republicans seem to Fallen to the X President Nazi Raciest Trump, the is a crook with selfish for hiding his crimes,That’s why he needs to be,More security papers found hiding inside his storage locker (Jailed) is were a Nazi needs to be"
"1503",2081764835,"I understand that the democracy should be respected and honored, however there are exceptions when a party decides for no honorable reason to cooperate with the President on making a sound decision which would be for the best for the People at which time there is a decision that the President should be allowed to make."
"1504",2082672585,"My answer was due to the current disgusting and down right blatant corruption of government. More pushback is required to compensate for the massive festering wounds our country has within major urban cities. Under ordinary circumstances my answer would reflect a more homogenous result."
"1505",2077935323,"Interesting question! I agree that my position is somewhat inconsistent. Much of the reason for my position that living in a representative democracy is important but that a Democratic president should issue executive orders is based on the fact that the rural/small state bias in the federal government makes it so that Democrats will have a more difficult time advancing their agenda. Additionally, executive orders that require funding will still require congressional support for allocating that money, meaning there is still a reasonable check on the president. Finally, if we (the citizens of a representative democracy) are unhappy with the executive orders, we do have recourse--elect a Republican president next time and he (or she) can undo the Democratic president's executive orders with the stroke of a pen."
"1506",2083193301,"Well considering how much corruption is going on with the Democratic Party right now I feel as though there will never be any more fair elections in America"
"1507",2088824169,"gerrymandering is bad"
"1508",2082959927,"no"
"1509",2083207365,"Todays democratic party is NOT like the old democratic party...most of todays democrats...especially those in politics are demon worshipers."
"1510",2081478671,"In this case, the Democratic President is attempting to pass new laws for the greater good of Americans. Republicans generally put their party ahead of the American people, and cannot be counted on to act for the benefit of the America people."
"1511",2082208653,"Because of gerrymandering, voter suppression and a very inequitable system of every state having 2 senators, republicans make up far less of the the electorate but have more power than democrats. Republicans represent a minority view but have an inordinate amount of power. A democratic president represents the views of the the majority of citizens. These executive orders tend to help people, like student loan borrowers or the children of immigrants. They promote equity and help regular people. It’s an attempt to balance the minority rule we have been living under and give the majority more of a voice."
"1512",2082393237,"very"
"1513",2082109713,"Because the president is also a representative in a representative democracy. He has been entrusted by voters to represent Americans, within the confines of the constitution. If the constitution affords him the right to make policy changes via exec order, and congress is being obstructionist, he should be allowed to do so. If the orders are unconstitutional, the courts won’t let them stand."
"1514",2088402725,"Yes I agree"
"1515",2081721269,"only way to get thing done"
"1516",2082759809,"Because the GOP is the party of No, only has control of Congress because of gerrymandering in several states and it seems that they will do nothing to help any Democratic President and their agenda."
"1517",2080339571,"Not sure"
"1518",2081671993,"Because democrats have always been on the receiving end of extremism - fueled by the GOP. “Freedom of Speech” is taken WAY too literal these days - there has to be censorship for hate speech, misinformation, extremism, antisemitic, etc - what side does that come from? - the GOP"
"1519",2081970499,"I have mixed opinions, sometimes they are good for one thing and bad for others"
"1520",2081975633,"Don't know"
"1521",2090072013,"Because the Republicans have a documented policy (by Mitch O'Connell) of summarily blocking any attempt by a Democratic administration to accomplish anything."
"1522",2082269715,"I think it is the democrat job to circumvent the congress when it comes to laws"
"1523",2090070663,"All depends on what is being said to cause censorship."
"1524",2081378947,"In light of the CURRENT state of our republic with so many far-right, fascist, anti-America republicans, the current POTUS must circumvent the do-nothing-but-obstruct party in order to get things done for all residents of the USA!"
"1525",2082254979,"Unfortunately, the track record of the last few decades has shown that Republicans believe in perpetual campaigning to keep them in power - regardless of whether or not they are doing their main job (which is to govern effectively for the people). The Democrats are slowly starting to emulate that practice (highly deplorable), but have not quite done so to the degree that the GOP politicians are doing. All Americans regardless of their ""stripe"" (red, blue, neutral) are the eventual losers in this. But at the moment, Democrat Chiefs of State still seem to care about the people. So yes, Democratic Presidents SHOULD circumvent Congress when it is difficult to obtain bipartisan hearing and support for issues that OUGHT TO concern both sides of the aisle. The people of America should come first; campaigns and continuation in power should come much lower in terms of priorities."
"1526",2082829735,"Because the country is unbalanced in representation. The voices of the people are represented by a couple of hundred of white, old men in congress. While the American population has become more diverse. There is no fair representation at the federal level. So yes, a democratic president should be able to create executive orders in the interest of the diverse people that voted for that democratic president."

In its new term, the high court will hear arguments in Moore v. Harper, a case from North Carolina involving the authority of the state legislature to gerrymander congressional maps for unfair partisan advantage. There is a strong possibility that the court’s conservative majority will adopt the anti-democratic independent state legislature (ISL) theory, which has been promoted by MAGA extremists claiming that there are virtually no checks and balances on state legislatures in key election matters, even by voters or their state’s own courts. This theory has long been considered to be on the fringes of conservative legal arguments and discredited by the Supreme Court for more than a century."

I don't think that they should constantly use executive orders to circumvent Congress, but sometimes it is necessary to get things done."

"1564",2082979377,"Republicans consistently, across the country, and at all levels of government, only win elections in areas affected by anti-democractic electoral practices, such as gerrymandering, the electoral college, making it difficult to vote due to demanding work schedules, not giving time off to vote and not allowing voting by mail (disproportionately impacting poor and minority voters), and recently straight up intimidating Democratic-leaning demographics (racial minorites and outwardly presenting LGBT individuals) with violence. Subverting the will of ""elected"" Republicans to enact Democratic policy goals is more representative than allowing Republicans a say due to unrepresentative elections."
"1565",2080944723,"The President is elected by the people. He or she is a representative. I believe the Republican Party when they state repeatedly that their highest priority is to obstruct the Democratic party’s agenda, and that is not a goal compatible with good-faith representation of the people or with effective governance. Republicans do not represent the will of the majority of voters: they frequently engage in gerrymandering and other forms of voter suppression to maintain power - up to and including attempting a coup when they lost an important election."
"1566",2082706269,"Executive orders are a power the president has. While a law takes an act of an entire branch of government to overturn, undoing an executive order is just a stroke of a pen by the next office holder.

I may have voted for a president based on his good decision making...executive orders on there own are available to be used and -on there own are Not illegal!"
"1575",2082390141,"The Democrats already do it. Plus that's the reason the ability to veto nor sign into law was given to a president. As we've seen this current president has grossly overused this right."

"1600",2082860457,"I think republicans in congress do not represent the actual population, or even just the population of republicans. 70%+ of Americans support some form of legal abortion, yet republicans in congress are unanimously opposed to it. Although we have a representative democracy, it doesn’t work well to reflect the views of the nation at all times."
"1601",2085843215,"Partisanship is a normal thing"
"1602",2082269751,"From my experience, many values of Republicans are in favor of discrimination and/or selfish beliefs. Also, Republican presidents would most likely choose Republicans for roles such as judges. Therefore, I think that Democratic officials should sometimes consider ignoring court decisions when the judges who made them were appointed by Republican presidents. I would feel more comfortable if the judges were equal in political affiliation (half Democratic and half Republican). This way, it is more likely that the decisions made will be unbiased, and then the officials, no matter what affiliation they belong to, can follow these decisions with ease, not having to consider ignoring or questioning them at all."
"1603",2092350457,"The president is also elected as a representative of the people"
"1604",2092277765,"The democratic congress always votes against anything the Republicans put forth"
"1605",2092467399,"Most people who vote for congress vote for Democrats, Republicans are able to obstruct because a minority of the voters live in low population states where they're in the majority. Urban and suburban areas are practically disenfranchised, especially in the Senate."
"1606",2092466371,"Yes I can explain. Far too many Republicans are not interested in governing at all. They only want ""to own the libs."" They will stand in the way of every piece of legislation, good or bad. If a Democratic president does not issue executive orders, there is a real probability that nothing will get done for two years. In order for the country to move forward, he must do this. It is the only alternative."
"1607",2092551175,"Divisiveness in congress. Some actions must be taken."
"1608",2099655277,"In 2016, the Republican Party stopped being a political party and became a hate group (and as of January 6, 2021, a terrorist group). Their abuses of our representative democracy have been so extreme and so destructive that it is (tragically) not always viable for Democrats to continue playing by the rules. Republicans act in bad faith and are now in the process of ending our Democracy. They are the Nazis of this time and place. I don't say it lightly or easily, but yes, sometimes Democrats need to do whatever they can to prevent a terrorist hate group from destroying our democracy."
"1609",2092518985,"A minority of Americans support Republican policies and red states are horribly gerrymandered. Also, the president has a legal right to issue executive orders and is elected by the people"
"1610",2091882927,"The country is so divided that allegiance to the party is more important than passing important legislation. I find the Republicans to be far more guilty of this practice than Democrats. I have approved of Biden's use of Executive Orders as they were not frivolous issues."
"1611",2091583281,"Yes, when it the will of the voters"
"1612",2093079457,"The government should be allowed to censor EITHER party that spends time attacking the other party. A representative democracy should be in the interest of ALL Americans."

"1614",2092518987,"because democrats are mostly corrupt and steal elections"
"1615",2092524995,"Given the current lack of cooperation in Congress, executive orders have at times become the only way to effect policy for both parties. I personally do not think it is a good way to govern, but I agree that it can be used when circumstances require it. I also consider the president as having been chosen by the voters as the leader of the government, making him the peoples' representative."
"1616",2092502011,"Because Democrat appointed judges follow woke ideology. And Democrat Judge's don't know who are male or female. And they abort innocent babies, free hard criminals, rapists and allow shoplifters go unpunished."
"1617",2093118613,"I was referring to laws that would be beneficial to both Democratic and Republican citizens, like something to do with child care tax credits, lower prescription drug costs, health care for all. Things that benefit both parties."
"1618",2092810347,"I struggled with that question. I feel like the current Republican Party is unreasonable and leaves the President without much choice. Generally I’d prefer to see more compromise. But republicans just seem to obstruct everything."
"1619",2091905567,"Republicans have been the party of ‘no’ since Obama. They don’t seek compromise they just want to obstruct. Executive orders are, sometimes, the only way to get things done."
"1620",2096189363,"because the republicans are obstructionists. They value party over country"
"1621",2088952421,"The Democrats will do everything they can to make our country socialist. A Republican President would try to make our country better for everyone. The Democrats have their own agenda and it is not for the benefit of the majority of American citizens."
"1622",2091763183,"It’s not fair to limit one side . There should be equal media reporting for both sides in our republic"
"1623",2099935967,"The Biden Administration is corrupt. They encourage the media to report their narrative. The main media is corrupt, siding with the Democratic Party. So how is it possible to censor the media by our present government?"
"1624",2092475821,"Since Obama was elected, Republicansvhave taken the stance to block ALL legislation the Democrats introduce. It is racist and bigoted and leaves Dem presidents no choice but to use all means possible to implement civil rights of citizens."
"1625",2092684333,"If the Republican party has no interest in the rule of law, except when they're in power, then whatever rules can be bent, to the people's will, should be followed to protect everyone. The Republicans have no real issue with the insurrection, except if/when Democrats are leading the charge."
"1626",2092384243,"I believe we all should be treated fairly no matter the party or the media"
"1627",2091298939,"Seriously, all fake media and social websites attack Republicans nonstop and only censor conservatives, as Twitter is now proving. It’s our turn to squash the voices of the unhinged, lunatic leftist."
"1628",2100339465,"Made a mistake on that."
"1629",2091732283,"Because that is the only way around a Republican Congress whose motto is to never agree with the Democratic President. How else do you handle obstinate childishness! If the President was elected by a majority vote then the people evidently want his agenda. Some Congressmen/women are only concerned with their re-election and not the concerns of the American people!"
"1630",2100541113,"It should only be true statements when censored. Not the Bullcrap they make up to make the story look good. Freedom of speech is one thing but slander of false accusations is another."
"1631",2093997957,"Those judges try to make their own laws in court. They only follow the rule of law when it supports their agenda. If they don't like the meaning of a law they make one up."
"1632",2091966517,"When you encounter a Supreme Court, such as we have today, that has a faulty interpretation of the Constitution, especially in regards to certain members’ ideologies, then you have a skewed view of the forefathers’ vision. Clarence Thomas fees that the SCOTUS can establish a Christian religion because they are not “congress.” The “no religious test” doctrine was set aside for Amy Coney Barrett because she was selected specifically for her religious beliefs. A woman who teaches Constitutional law, yet cannot recite the freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution."
"1633",2093329659,"When it is not good for the american people"
"1634",2090742379,"Sometimes the only way to get things accomplished is through executive order. Not to be used on a regular basis. Only when there are a few stragglers that will not comply with others"
"1635",2092816377,"The Republican members of Congress have obstructed progress for years (since Obama) and sometimes things just need to get done."
"1636",2092694495,"Rules are made to be broken. It still shows that we will stand ground for American rights"
"1637",2092654149,"Some legislation, such as climate action, faces stiff opposition forom fossil fuel lobbyist and the elected officials that are supported by the lobbyists. To protect the planet, executive orders might be needed."
"1638",2099650653,"Because there has been so much gerrymandering of election districts that we are no longer a representative government ."
"1639",2100433517,"Because the Republican are not voting truth. The are only going with the majority leader of their party"
"1640",2093116297,"It is very clear to me the Dems cheat the fuck out of us in the election, just watch Dinesh D'Souza's Documentary 10,000 Mules. I knew that before his Documentary. Welcome to the new fucking world order!!!!!"
"1641",2099655197,"Our ""representative democracy"" has given the President those powers. I entirely endorse removing them, BUT we have what our ""representative democracy"" has given us. Congress can change all that. But they don't. Congress would prefer to do nothing, not take a vote, not have a record. Nearly all of the functions of Congress are done in secret, behind closed doors, followed by a press conference. Leaders in a ""representative democracy"" do not keep their actions secret from the citizens."
"1642",2093442193,"It has to be fair no matter the political party."
"1643",2099843949,"If I did Vote I will always vote Democrat"
"1644",2092476349,"As a Democrat I find a lot of fault within the Republican party. These faults include the use of lies and deception. We have seen this in the actions and speech of our last president. The republican party is still on the path of more controls of the ""People"" and less against the Big Business"" and it's controlling tactics. The Democratic Party has always been more for the working man and less for big business. Granted our country would fail drastically if not for the business and industry faction but we definitely need more successful cooperation between the two. The Democratic party has been put down for the attention paid to the working men and women that ""Support"" big business with their hard work."
"1645",2091954837,"i find that most republicans think and act more clearly than most democrats"
"1646",2093808273,"The media has proven to be corrupt and are just an extension of the democratic party. I believe the majority of americans have lost trust that the media can be truthful."
"1647",2092357505,"Because that's what democrats do & it appears we are going to have to fight by their rules if we are to ever win another election."
"1648",2099929161,"If a President is duly elected by the people based on an agenda to accomplish goals favored by the people. I would not generally encourage using executive orders, but it some cases and or policy the sitting President has an obligation to satisfy campaign promises"
"1649",2100571833,"it is important"
"1650",2092343423,"The republicans need to stick together more than they do now"
"1651",2091481933,"It's a war, the two parties will never again agree. The President has to do what he can to run the country."
"1652",2092476859,"The Media censors most republicans not any Dems"
"1653",2092186255,"When Democrats do everything to harass and persecute a Republican, it may be the only way to accomplish priorities."
"1654",2093365113,"Because these medium sources generally lie"
"1655",2092604919,"When the current president came in he struck down the the previous president's exec orders and created many of his own. I now believe we need to even the playing field by saying everyone gets to or no one gets to. While I believe it's important to live in a representative democracy; I'm not so naive as to believe our leaders of either party agree."
"1656",2091966637,"Just leaning to the Right."
"1657",2091958869,"Under the leadership of Mitch McConnell, Republicans in Congress long ago stopped participating in representative democracy. When there is a mindful effort to block duly elected presidents from achieving any legislative goals, then there is no other choice. I'm actually glad to see a bit of a return to 'pork,' which provides an incentive for passing legislation (as opposed to obstruction and 'owning the libs'). I would much prefer negotiation and compromise, but until there is a sufficient number of GQP legislators willing to play, the system remains broken. Executive action is temporary fix to solve problems, and it's a bad solution as remedies are easily undone and changed by a future administration."

"1661",2092564587,"Both parties should be honoring the election rules and the constitution. Democrats will do anything and everything to get elected. Republicans will do it the right way."
"1662",2093604727,"First of all the Democratic Party governs for all the people in the country and the Repulican Party only want to obstruct everything the democate Presisdent put forth. The repulican party only cares about the rich donors and large corporations with tax cuts."
"1663",2090414155,"I am a Democrat & I agree with most of the Democrats who I believe are fair & helps the people"
"1664",2092476307,"If the Democratic POTUS cannot get the Congress to act at all on a critical issue, he or she should act on those parts of the issue that he can."
"1665",2099333179,"your wording is kind of tricky I believe in democracy Media sources such as Carlton Tucker and Hannity are just ridicules I can't understand how they can continue to be on the air with the hatred that they breed daily"
"1666",2093541795,"Its not fair to favor one party over the other"
"1667",2098725923,"Because I believe that sometimes machines can be rigged to favor one candidate over the other."
"1668",2099900485,"I believe executive orders are ok as long as they are within the framework of the constitution and would not according to guidelines require Congress approval"
"1669",2100516505,"Because Republican's will not do anything that would help the American people while it's a Democratic President. Every time there is a Democratic President, they do everything to block them, then when the next election comes, they scream see they didn't get anything done all while skipping the part about them blocking everything."
"1670",2098893705,"I don't think attacking your opponents verbally is a great way to represent democracy."
"1671",2092757375,"The question was poorly worded, there was no correct answer so I chose closest to the correct. I believe that any election that is questioned by a candidate or a large number of voters should be carefully audited and investigated regardless of the party. This isn't loyalty to a party, and it isn't minimizing loyalty to election rules or the constitution. Questionable elections are the opposite of living in a representative democracy. All voters should have faith in our elections, but we don't and the problems started a long time before Trump."
"1672",2092620813,"I think if all sides are locked and no one is working together for the sake of the people the president should be able to override them all they sometimes forget they are working for the people and while they play there push and shove back and forth games we the people are the ones who suffer"
"1673",2099486547,"It's a fact that the media, social media, Hollywood elites support democrats and liberals so media hide facts, media lies to the public to help the democratic party, also it's prove that the presidential and midterm elections are being rigged to go in favor to democrats"

"1683",2092525653,"I feel like Democrats are in the position of bringing a knife to a gun fight. Republicans, by and large, are supporting Trump and others like him in their attempts to overthrow the government and install a fascist dictatorship. Even though the midterm elections went surprisingly well for Democrats, they lost control of the House because Republican-controlled states are more likely to perform extreme gerrymandering to ensure Republicans are elected, while Democratic-controlled states are more likely to have non-partisan bodies draw district boundaries. Similarly, Republicans in states like Georgia have given it their all to suppress the votes of poorer and black voters. If Democrats don't retaliate in kind, working to suppress votes of Republicans, we're more likely to end up with a Republican-controlled Congress voting to install a fascist dictator as President, regardless of what the votes of the people say. We saw it from McConnell's devious maneuver to prevent Obama from being able to put in a new Supreme Court justice after Scalia died. Republicans just aren't interested in following norms. If there are laws, they might break them. If there are norms not backed by laws, like in McConnell's situation, they will for sure break them, especially since the rise of Trump. Democrats must fight back and violate norms too, to prevent complete Republican takeover of the country and installation of a fascist dictatorship. You can write me off as a loony as you sit in your office and analyze your survey results, but if you're honest with yourself, you know this is a serious possibility."

"1687",2091972705,"I’m in favor of that only in certain circumstances. For instance, if the majority leader states that their only objective is to prevent the president from making any progress with anything at all, then the president would have to use other methods to do any of the things he was voted in for"

"1689",2093987101,"I strongly agreed that the government should be able to censor media sources that spend more time attacking republicans, because although I value democracy, I am against bullying and oppression of any kind.

"1710",2092781533,"I don't think executive orders circumvent democracy. They're an allowable use of a President's powers and the President is also an elected representative of the people. Too often the opposing party values their party's interests above those of the country and the will of their own constituents and refuses to engage in any form of compromise. When obstructionism becomes the norm, there aren't many other ways to get anything done."

"1722",2100573851,"Representative democracy is currently broken because of gerrymandering across the country to a point where even if the majority of voters prefer Democratic representatives, we end up with the opposite. This is how we ended up with a Democratic president with a barely Republican Congress and does not represent the will of the majority of Americans."
"1723",2093599565,"I honestly can't explain, I don't follow politics but I know our last president was a republican and made bad choices therefore I'm not fond of Republicans"

"1726",2092676965,"Different branches, different powers. I see no reason a president shouldn't issue executive orders that aren't explicitly prohibited if there is a reasonable argument that they should be allowed to do it. If congress objects, they should get their shit together and outlaw it. If someone else objects, they can attempt to push it through the courts. That's the beauty of checks and balances. Stop asking leading questions like this."

Yes, until the conservatives can be heard freely what is going on in our government under Democrat control needs to be cleaned up."
"1738",2092786379,"Like now Trump does not want the Republicans helping Biden at all cause he was impeached twice. I think where the Reps. chose to turn the map in their favor and also decided to stand with an ex president who broke the law and did what he wanted with no percussions then I think Biden should do what he wants. He should be able to do what he thinks Americans want."

I don't know that I'd like it on all issues, but the constitution gives the president that authority to circumvent congress at times."
"1743",2095761543,"The Republican party is more interested in serving its own interests, making a profit, and taunting Democrats than it is serving the interests of the American people. In recent months, it has shown over and over again that it does not care about human rights in any form. Politicians who choose to violate human rights and remove human rights protections should always be able to be overruled."
"1744",2096170415,"Because nothing would get done."
"1745",2090317791,"I did not feel there was an answer choice that accurately reflected my opinion but this was the closest. I think other Republicans should be supportive of the party but should also adhere to election rules and the Constitution. These are not mutually exclusive."
"1746",2097260861,"the president is elected and his views are approved by the voters who elected him. Republicans often try to block bills based not on merit but party. Executive orders are legal and if not illegal courts can review them and strike them down."
"1747",2093969967,"The US, which is a representative democracy, has THREE co-equal branches of government. Congress passes laws which often do not address all functional issues related to them. Presidential executive orders, subject to judicial review, are a necessary Constitutional power of the Executive branch, historically used by BOTH PARTIES, to help execute the overall function of the Government."
"1748",2092742409,"We’ve seen that Republicans would would let everyone in the country die rather than work with a Democratic President. If they want to act like children, matters have to go over their head."
"1749",2089234937,"Because the folks in power have gerrymandered the maps so we don’t live in a truly representative democracy. Also the Republican party is dead set on obstruction of the democratic agenda- not on representing their constituents."
"1750",2098767615,"A representative democracy isn’t perfect—no system of government is. We have a two party system that creates too much deadlock as one side increasingly becomes fascist and the other remains centrist. On important and pressing issues a president has the power to pass legislation that wouldn’t get out of Congress."
"1751",2086309059,"I only meant that if Republicans reduce polling stations in Democratic areas then Democrats should reduce the polling stations in Republican districts as a counter measure- tit for tat so to speak. Actually, there should be ample amount of polling stations in a district whatever the makeup of the district is to be fair (but I live in a Red state and Dem areas always get screwed over) and no one should have to wait in line longer than 30min- 15 being the best. Same day registration or no cutoff should be allowed too- this isn't the 18th. century . A person's necessary paper work can be checked with computers now and verified."
"1752",2098315495,"Because the current Republican Party of late has devolved into a deranged death cult. Republicans can't be trusted to do the right thing until to disown Trumpism and expel the Q-Anon loving, fascist leaning crazies from their party."

"1756",2093885973,"I think that it depends on the issue and the context. Certain things should be able to be accomplished by executive order, while others should only be able to be done by getting buy-in from congress."
"1757",2091380649,"Balance of power has shifted. It appears when Republicans have a majority or can effectively stop all legislation they exercise this power. My sense of the power plays is that the Republican party attempts to stop any/all legislation that is pushed by the Democratic party even if the new laws clearly benefit most of society. They are not offering solutions, and marinade in hypocrisy."
"1758",2092769891,"I don’t believe that a president issuing executive orders runs contradictory to democratic values. After all, the president is also an elected official. By being elected a president has somewhat of a mandate from the American people to push forward their agenda."

"1763",2092897701,"Democratic representative in senators represent more of the population than Republicans. Republicans, a minority of the population, are trying to impose theocratic based laws and majority. That is anti-American as it gets and deserves overturning by almost any means necessary."
"1764",2099606753,"The Obama presidency began an unprecedented time of obstruction by Republicans. I suspect his election, because he is African American, was the precursor to the resurgence of issues we settled through the Civil Rights Movement. The current Republican platform is non-existent. They take every opportunity to criticize and undermine efforts by the Democrats, who mostly appear to be trying to address issues important to the American people, while refusing to do anything to improve the lives of their constituents. The refusal of the republican controlled senate to vote on the nomination of Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court following the untimely death of Justice Scalia was unprecedented. Thereafter, while in power, they confirmed Amy Coney Barrett, who has very little judicial experience, in record time after the death of Justice Bader Ginsburg. Since then, they have used the courts to impede progress in spite of the voters rejecting the republicans repeatedly. Governing in this climate is virtually impossible, so Executive Orders are the way administrations have resorted to bring about the will of the voters."
"1765",2092564687,"If the country elected a democratic president, that president has the right to make changes using the executive branch. If the other party in congress is being obstinate, sometimes this is the only option."

Republican representatives work for the good of wealthy white people, often to the detriment of a large portion of Americans. It is increasingly necessary to circumvent Republicans in order to keep our society free and fair."

"1775",2093235919,"Many times the court makes wrong decisions"

"1777",2092770317,"We don’t currently live in a representative democracy; electoral college is NOT equally representative. Republicans in congress do not compromise or work with Democrats, even when they have previously supported legislation."
"1778",2094336879,"Republicans have proven over and over that their goal is to prevent initiatives of any Democratic President even if those initiatives are for the benefit of the entire country. Republicans prefer party over the good over the good of the nation and even the constitution."
"1779",2097280441,"Because some of the media sources are biased and attack the Democrats, and they must court it"

"1795",2092285919,"If it is legal to issue those orders, that it is part of how our system has been structured. Folks can & do sue to block those orders — and back in the day when we had a non-right wing $ captured SCOTUS, Presidents of both parties would get a fair shake. But tbqh the way our society has changed, we don’t live in a truly representative democracy anymore, given the Electoral College & the 2 Senators for every state no matter the population BS. And life terms for SCOTUS - we should change our SCOTUS structure to be more like real democratic countries like say Germany. US is heading for even more of a crisis if it doesn’t become more reflective of the views of the majority of US voters."
"1796",2098798863,"The current Republican party has made it known they will not pass laws just to spite Democrats, which I do not find that representative because those laws will help working class constituents on all sides."

"1798",2092770371,"The reason I feel this way is because the Republican Party is becoming extreme. All you have to look at Marjorie Taylor Green, Lauren Boebert extreme views on gun control, abortion, and being radical Christians. The fact that most of the Republican party did not feel that January 6th was not an insurrection is insane. Finally, supporting Donald Trump without questioning him on any of his actions means they have no honor and only want power."
"1799",2092377293,"I think Republicans will not cooperate with Democrats no matter what the issue, simply on principle. Executive orders are the best way to even the playing field, and probably even more representational of the public as a whole, if not overused/misused."
"1800",2092807271,"Because each state has two senators only, the senate skews to rural states that don't represent the majority of the people. The state districting maps are gerrymandered and our electoral college is so broken, two presidents didn't win the majority vote in my lifetime. In addition the obstructionism of Obama's presidency who made a lot of effort to compromise, made executive orders seem like his only recourse. I don't think executive orders should be the first option however."
"1801",2099558861,"Take a look at the last sixty years. Republicans have made it a party policy to obstruct any attempts at actual governing, particularly when a Democratic politician is likely to be thought of favorably by the public for it. It robbed Obama of a rightful SCOTUS justice pick, and gave THREE to Trump. And Trump had zero qualms about writing EOs for anything he wanted, even when it was illegal, to the applause of the Republican party. Why shouldn't a Democratic president use legal EOs at every opportunity, when Congressional Republicans have dedicated themselves to ensuring nothing at all gets accomplished? If Congressional Republicans were serious about bipartisanship and compromise, EOs would not be necessary & Congress could fulfilled its elected duties as intended, but they are not, and Republicans SAY AS MUCH in their own video clips. Where do YOU draw the line, at negotiating with known insurrectionists, who conspired together for your murder?"
"1802",2094013771,"In places where republicans are majority, they tend to be violent or try to obstaculize democrat polls"

If it can be proven that the issue is being stonewalled, and at an impass, the president should have the authority to circumvent the congress in its whole to temporarily put measures into place to lead the country out of whatever crisis it faces. A person is smart, a group can be foolish."

"1806",2093540797,"Executive Orders have a lot of limitations on them. You can't completely bypass congress for most things. For example reducing student loan debt by a measly 10k. That got stopped in the courts. However I think the president should do what they can through executive order if congress is locked up. This unfortunately happens a lot because the Republicans are more interested in stopping Democrats from doing anything than actually doing their jobs. To summarize I'm OK with it because executive action has limits and if a president goes too far the courts act as a checks and balance."

"1811",2093853059,"The president is generally understood to have the power to respond to emergencies in the country under article 2. If a republican congress fails to respond to the point that an issue reaches the level of an emergency, the president should issue an executive order"

In theroy executive orders can be over turned by next admin, and/or the judicary. However, the current state of the Judicary has issues as well with adminstartive stays (recent supreme court case)"
"1813",2093766077,"It's a perfectly legal action. If the voters don't like it, they should elect people who will pass laws that curtail a President's power to do it.

"1814",2092425527,"When the opposite party makes statements that they will oppose anything proposed by the president before hand its time for exectuive action. This applies to any party."
"1815",2093118879,"Sometimes Republican legislators sabotage the work of the President which bears direct benefits to our country. E.g Ted Cruz blocking the appointment of ambassadors because he doesn't agree with President Biden is a form of sabotage and bad faith legislating, therefore, Biden should utilize his powers to appoint Ambassadors"
"1816",2100220933,"Isn't that what Donald Trump did? How will anything get passed IF Republicans won't work with Democrats? It took Biden & the Democrats to pass laws regarding insulin pricing, infrastructure etc....Republicans NEVER did any of that"
"1817",2095104275,"The law may be a good thing for the people but the other party are against it just to oppose. Which in turn hurts the country"
"1818",2099557423,"Because there is cheating going on."
"1819",2092080697,"I think that they should know that the Democratic Party is most likely doing what’s best for the people."
"1820",2093235789,"Sometimes few may haven't supported but thats not right."
"1821",2096469241,"I suppose it is a lack of bias because I lean more towards democracy, but the reality is that the opinion of each person must be respected, whether or not they are Republican"
"1822",2096983121,"no"
"1823",2092599843,"they need more knowalge"
"1824",2100529437,"Because opposing congress members do things like this out of their own beliefs and they don't do it for their voters. Like with defending gay marriage, even the majority of Republican voters support gay rights yet so many Republicans in congress didn't want to protect gay rights. You need to go by what the people want!"
"1825",2099657441,"Election rules and the constitution are manipulated and sometimes the votes of Americans are not represented at the public level. The rules of the Constitution and elections must be changed to more accurately reflect the majority of Americans' views."
"1826",2100024487,"Depending on the issue- no single people should be able to cause harm and issues to a mass of people. To be honest, I don't know a lot about politics and the lingo for everything. But from what I've gathered, there are a lot of republicans purposely making things take a long time and being inconclusive and being pushed off repeatedly. And when it comes to human rights, Republicans are the only ones standing in the way of people having them. If the roles were reveresed between the parties I would still feel the same."
"1827",2093157403,"Favouritism may begin to act up in the media house. So every event or news should be censored by the government before cast"
"1828",2092800299,"Intentional obfuscation by one political group cannot be allowed to gridlock the country."
"1829",2088541727,"Because we can't change law without cooperation with republican members"
"1830",2092077885,"While it would be ideal to live in a representative democracy that is fair and just I do believe there is fraud in elections (especially by republicans) so it’s not always by and for the people. Sometimes you have to fight fire with fire to get the necessary results."
"1831",2092599681,"This is to make sure that the party remain strong irrespective of their differences.This will also ensure them retention of the seat."
"1832",2092800291,"no"
"1833",2092447235,"Judges appointed by Republican presidents in the last few years have held values that are immoral and challenge the dignity and worth of human beings. Therefore said judges are more likely to judge and rule in ways that do not allow people to live their best, safest and healthiest lives. For example, Barrett is extremely against abortion so if faced with a case where a person had to have an abortion to save her own life, Barrett would likely find the person guilty of crimes if abortion were deemed illegal."
"1834",2092734407,"no"
"1835",2092785235,"no"
"1836",2093092539,"I don't know how to say."
"1837",2092899621,"If the media source is attacking people, I don’t believe that falls under the guise of living under a representative democracy."
"1838",2093123105,"I think as long as it is right and reasonable, I"
"1839",2093038753,"I feel that the media portrays things in an awful light no matter what the party, or circumstance. I feel like we should be able to cut the media out at times cuz a lot of what they report goes based off others agendas or whatever they choose to report."
"1840",2099599417,"If those verdicts are un-democratic, which Republican presidents and nominees can issue rulings that are, then there is a duty to ignore those rulings and decisions, similarly to how Andrew Jackson ignored court orders in the 1800s (Jackson was still a bad president though, not defending Jackson’s character)."
"1841",2091949927,"it is unique and re"
"1842",2092648699,"Democrats break election rules and cheat in elections far more often and more obviously than republicans"
"1843",2092672875,"Presidents lay out planned agenda when running for office, the elected. When congressional members no longer act in good faith (to stall progress for personal or political gain) then the president should act and use all tools available. Congress is able to challenge legality if the president has over stepped authority."
"1844",2100274245,"Because most of these judges are politicians on robes . They have no problem whatsoever playing partisan politics. Most judge shop and they are destroying the country"
"1845",2097217647,"I think they are wasting their time polling there tbh"
"1846",2093152649,"I said that because there needs to be Union among the Congress members"
"1847",2092811091,"I do not agree with the latter"
"1848",2092885723,"By my political inclination"
"1849",2101353901,"I answered “neither agree nor disagree”, not “agree”. However, if there’s important legislation that needs to pass and if GOP pulls their usual bullshit and blocks it, I’m in favor. Depends on the legislation."
"1850",2101466375,"When the early polls are taken and the the Republican is in the lead then suddenly the Democrats wins, there will be lots of questions."
"1851",2099084967,"If the Democrats (or Republicans for that matter) are purely playing politics and not putting the American people first; then a president should be able to rise above that. It seems that many in Congress, especially the Democrats, are more interested in seeing Republicans fail (especially Donald Trump) than to see a Republican’s policy help Americans."
"1852",2102020949,"Any such censoring should be applied EQUALLY, doesn't matter which party. The difficult part is who the censors are. They have to be impartial or the whole thing falls apart. For example, the current SCOTUS clearly is NOT impartial and the censorship from them would be biased and not trusted."
"1853",2099182003,"THERE SHOULD BE FAIRNESS IN ALL MEDIA. THE TRUTH SHOULD ALWAYS BE THE PRESENT."
"1854",2101287807,"Trump issued many executive orders to get around congress. so why not give the Democrats the same. Members of congress should be elected by how they are not by party. Democrats in many ways don't agree with party. Republicans the same. every person running should tell how they feel and not beat around the bush as many do. Is it a yes I agree with democracy or a no. Yes on immigration or no. If have specific feelings they should specifically tell them to help people know who to vote for. Are you anti abortion because your party says so or what are actual feelings NEVER LIE TO GET ELECTED. That seems to be coming common place. That is why we need new honest people in government"
"1855",2102021541,"I think it should work for Democrat and RepublicanPresident to get laws passed."

"1863",2102021393,"Circumventing Congress should be last resort, only after Congress has refused to negotiate and compromise in a bipartisan manner."
"1864",2101573845,"I live in a very gerrymandered state, making more Republican seats in the legislature which did not reflect the number of Democratic votes.

"1867",2101505923,"Because so far, elections rules have not followed the constitution, have been very different in many counties and states, have been trampled on by activists, mostly liberal and democrats.
